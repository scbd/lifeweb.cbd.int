		"summary": "The Mt Vaea Ecosystem Resilience and Forest Restoration project is the first demonstration project of invasive plant management and forest restoration in Samoa. The project will focus on implementing the operational plan for restoring Mt. Vaea Nature Reserve (MNRE, 2014). There are two main components to the project, firstly the selective removal of invasive weeds, and secondly replanting the reserve with selected native plant species. More importantly, the project will help achieve and implement some of the objectives and priority actions highlighted in the National Invasive Species Action Plan (NISAP) and Samoa’s National Biodiversity Strategy Action Plan (NBSAP), as well as Aichi Targets.  Mt Vaea is the most visited reserve in Samoa by locals and tourists due to its beautiful panorama view from the top, and where the late writer Robert Louis Stevenson rests forever.",
		"description": "Invasive plants are a major threat to the biodiversity of Samoa because they continue to spread unabated. This project will research and develop techniques for managing invasive plants, and restoring the native forest. Additionally, given the site’s rugged topography, steep slopes, and erodible soils, it is important that a more resilient environment is built by replacing invasive trees that are prone to storm damage, with native ones.  A recent survey (2013) shows an increase of invasive plant species coverage on the site. Recent landslides in the reserve following heavy rain have occurred in areas dominated by invasive tree species which tend to be less well-rooted and more easily dislodged in stormy weather than native tree species. The biggest threats now are the vulnerability of the area to soil erosion and degradation, and the loss of natural habitats and ecosystem by the dominance of existing and new invasive alien species to the site.",

Specifically, the project will improve the ecosystem functions of the forest in Mt Vaea that has been severely degraded by the introduction of non-native forest tree species as a buffer to the negative effects of climate change. Observations indicate that native plant species are more resilient to climate change than introduced invasive plant species."

However, as a result of the severe degradation that exists now because of the presence of non-native species and vulnerability to natural disasters, their connection to the forest has been decreased considerably. The project will therefore seek to renew and strengthen this connection by engaging community members in project activities, and through awareness campaigns.<br/>Another aspect of this project is to provide a better experience to tourists that visit this site every year to visit the grave of Robert Louis Stevenson, the Scottish writer whose grave is located at the top of Mt Vaea.<br/><br/>Apart from being the location of the late Author R.L. Stevenson, the mountain has a legend/story that explains the linkage between the Samoan and Fijian chiefly systems in the distant past."

		"summary": "The Ministry of Environment, represented by the Galapagos National Park Directorate and Galapagos Biosecurity Agency, will work with the Floreana Parish Council, Island Conservation, and other partners to build Floreana Island’s resilience to climate change through ecosystem restoration and long-term protection. In particular, we will: a) eradicate invasive alien species (cats, rats, mice), b) re-establish viable populations of the IUCN Critically Endangered Floreana mockingbird (Mimus trifasciatus) and the recently rediscovered Floreana giant tortoise (Chelonoidis elephantopus), and c) implement a series of community-based activities (e.g., pride campaign, biosecurity programme, training in conflict transformation) to help ensure the sustainability of Floreana Island’s biodiversity and the 140 people whose livelihoods directly depend on it. The project advances Aichi Biodiversity Targets 5 (habitats conserved), 9 (invasive alien species managed), and 12 (extinction prevented) and will provide a model for similar work on other inhabited islands in Ecuador (e.g., Isla de la Plata) and beyond.",
		"description": "This project seeks to restore island ecosystems and secure human livelihoods by eradicating invasive alien species and re-establishing locally extinct species. Project success will facilitate climate change resilience on human-inhabited islands in Ecuador and beyond.<br/><br/>Ecuador is one of the 17 megadiverse countries in the world. Main threats to the country’s biodiversity include deforestation, invasive alien species, natural resource extraction, and climate change. Ecuador recently submitted its 5th National Report to the CBD, describing the country’s current and future progress towards achieving the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in conjunction the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 (5th National Report: https://www.cbd.int/reports/nr5/). Strategic and timely actions to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change and invasive alien species are conservation imperatives.<br/><br/>The Galapagos Islands are among the ‘jewels’ of Ecuador and a top conservation priority; their rich, endemic biodiversity (>95% of species extant) draws substantial nature-based tourist income (@US$1 billion/year). In order to facilitate protection of its unique biodiversity, Ecuador created the Galapagos National Park in 1959 and designated the Galapagos Marine Reserve in 1996. In acknowledgment of their global conservation value, the Galapagos Islands became the first World Heritage Site in 1978 and were designated as a UNESCO-Man and Biosphere Reserve in 1984. However, largely due to threats posed by invasive alien species, UNESCO listed the Galapagos Islands as a World Heritage Site in Danger in 2007. Because they are inhabited by endemic species that persist on a single island complex, Floreana Island and two of its satellite islands have recently been identified as an Alliance for Zero Extinction site (http://www.zeroextinction.org/).<br/><br/>This proposed project focuses on the ecological restoration and long-term protection of Floreana Island, a 173 km2 human-inhabited island in the Galapagos Archipelago, which hosts 54 IUCN Red Listed species (10 Critically Endangered, 18 Endangered, and 26 Vulnerable species), the world’s largest Galapagos petrel (Pterodroma phaeopygia) breeding colony, and 11 nesting seabird species. <br/><br/>Whalers began visiting Floreana Island regularly in the late 1700s. Floreana Island was the first Galapagos island to be settled (1832), and is now home to 140 people who rely on nature-based tourism, farming, and fisheries for their livelihood. Due to the long history of human activity, Floreana Island has experienced the most significant habitat degradation and highest level of species loss of any island in the Galapagos. Over the past 300 years at least 12 native species have been extirpated from the island, largely due to the adverse impacts of invasive alien species [the exceptions being the Floreana giant tortoise (Chelonoidis elephantopus and Galapagos hawk (Buteo galapagoensis) which were also overharvested]. Four native species have become locally extinct in just the last 30 years. <br/><br/>Ecuadorian conservation agencies and non-governmental organizations, as well as the people of Floreana Island, currently share a strong interest in the repatriation of two of Floreana Island’s endemic species: the Floreana mockingbird (Mimus trifasciatus) and Floreana giant tortoise (Chelonoidis elephantopus).<br/><br/>The Floreana mockingbird is included on the IUCN Red List as a Critically Endangered species due to the small size of the remaining population (85-231 individuals) and tendency of the population size to fluctuate with extreme weather events. In 2007, a particularly dry year on Floreana Island, the total global population of Floreana mockingbirds declined to 46 adults. The species became extinct on Floreana Island between 1868 and 1880, and can now only be found on two rodent- and cat-free satellite islets off Floreana Island’s coast, Champion (0.1 km2) and Gardner-by-Floreana (0.8 km2). The status of the Floreana mockingbird is monitored on an annual basis.<br/><br/>For approximately 150 years, the Floreana giant tortoise was thought to have been driven to extinction by human harvesting and invasive alien species (e.g., rats and cats that prey on hatchling tortoises). However, genetic studies recently revealed that the Floreana giant tortoise still persists in the wild on the northern end of the island of Isabela, a few hundred kilometers from its place of origin on Floreana Island.  The tortoises were likely released on Isabela Island by seafarers who had collected them on Floreana Island for food. These findings provide great hope for recovery of this species, as well as the other native species that depended on its services as a herbivore and seed disperser. A few individuals of the species now constitute the nucleus of a small captive breeding population being led by the Galapagos National Park Directorate on Santa Cruz Island. <br/><br/>Feral goats (Capra hircus) were successfully removed from Floreana Island in 2007 by the Galapagos National Park Directorate in collaboration with the Floreana Parish Council. However, feral cats (Felis catus)  and invasive alien rats (Rattus rattus) and mice (Mus musculus) remain a threat to biodiversity and people. The eradication of invasive alien species from Floreana Island will not only enable the recovery of individual species, it will facilitate ecosystem recovery and resilience to environmental change. Ecuador’s National Climate Change Plan (2013) promotes ecosystem-based approaches (e.g., invasive alien species eradication) to climate mitigation. <br/><br/>Eradicating invasive alien species to build resilience to climate change is as much a socio-cultural issue as it is an ecological issue. The residents of Floreana Island recognize that they are being negatively impacted by invasive alien species (e.g., through crop losses, disease risk transmission) and that they are highly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change (e.g., extreme weather events). The Floreana Parish Council has requested support from the Government of Ecuador and its partners to help safeguard their future. This project will help meet their needs by increasing food and income security (especially from tourism), eliminating disease risks, and fostering community cohesion and empowerment through training in conflict transformation and implementation of a campaign intended to build pride in the island’s endemic species (hereafter ‘pride campaign’).<br/><br/>Recognizing the value to biodiversity conservation and human livelihoods, invasive alien vertebrate eradications have already been successfully completed on 1,100 islands worldwide, the vast majority of which are uninhabited (http://diise.islandconservation.org/). Approximately 50% of IUCN Critically Endangered and Endangered island-based mammals, reptiles, and amphibians exist on islands that also have human populations greater than 10,000 people (http://tib.islandconservation.org/). There is a clear and immediate need to advance innovative approaches and tools to eradicate invasive alien vertebrates on human-inhabited islands. Success of the Floreana Island project proposed herein will set a global precedent, enabling new climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation projects on hundreds of human-inhabited islands in Ecuador, and across the world. <br/><br/>Summary of Threats and Opportunities<br/><ul><br/><li>Invasive alien species (eradicate invasive alien rodents and feral cats; strengthen biosecurity program)</li><br/><li>Climate change (restore and protect island ecosystems; build social resilience through training in conflict transformation and a community-empowering pride campaign)</li><br/><li>Extirpation of endemic species (reintroduce Floreana mockingbird and Floreana giant tortoise post-rodent and feral cat eradication)</li><br/></ul>",

Significant vegetation recovery followed goat removal, particularly the regeneration and maturation of woody plant species which have significant carbon sequestration properties.

				"comment": "Although the Galapagos Archipelago hosts just one thousandth of the inhabitants of Ecuador, their importance in absolute terms is vastly larger; the Galapagos Islands serve as a symbol of the Ecuadorian nation. Conservation of the Galapagos Islands thus has a strong cultural component for Ecuador:  (a) the Archipelago symbolizes the country’s international image at the tourist level, (b) the islands are part of the natural heritage of protected areas, belonging to all Ecuadorians; (c) the proper management and conservation of the Archipelago empowers Ecuador's international image as a country responsible for the management and use of natural ecosystems as a source of environmental services, determining the welfare of its population and (d) the Galapagos Islands are one of the best symbols of Ecuadorian nationality and sovereignty.<br/>Floreana Island’s cultural history is the best known and, arguably, the most compelling in the Galapagos.  Because Floreana Island offered one of the only reliable year-round freshwater springs in the Galapagos Islands and a diversity of plant and animal species, it was a destination for pirates and other seafarers to stop and replenish their water and meat supplies (targeting giant tortoises). In order to create shelter, these Floreana Island visitors carved holes in the soft stone of the island highlands. These structures, sometimes referred to as ‘The Stonehenge of The Galapagos,’ are now a tourist curiosity. <br/>Whalers began visiting Floreana Island regularly in the late 1700s. They established a ‘post office’ in a barrel; whalers would leave letters and pick up letters to deliver en route to other destinations. The ‘post office’ is still intact and used by the island’s tourists. The Galapagos National Park and Floreana Island’s community tourism project is in the process of reopening the historic trail between the highlands and Post-office Bay which was used for taking agricultural products from the highlands to visiting boats to trade for other commodities. <br/>The Wittmer family settled on Floreana Island in 1832. Several books have been written about the mysterious disappearances and deaths that occurred thereafter. The stories remain a fascination and draw for tourists. In 1835, Charles Darwin visited Floreana Island where he collected specimens that would later inspire the publication (‘On the Origin of Species’) in which he established the theory of evolution. <br/>Floreana Islanders revere the spectacle of Galapagos petrels searching for and entering their nesting burrows at Cerro Pajas – a vegetated volcanic cone in the highlands.  The site is naturally constructed like a massive amphitheater, creating an echo chamber for the voices of hundreds of petrels calling simultaneously. This spectacle is considered one of natural wonders that make Floreana Island unique. Galapagos petrels are part of the identity of Floreana Islands, as are the extirpated Floreana mockingbird and Floreana giant tortoise. These species constitute a critically endangered aspect of the human heritage of the island and its people, a heritage which is currently threatened by invasive alien species.<br/>"

The rodent impact is so substantial that entire fields of maize and cassava can be devastated while rodent control measures are being applied.  The eradication of invasive rats and mice will completely eliminate these crop losses.<br/><br/>Invasive alien rodents also have a negative impact on fisheries through the consumption of inter-tidal species such as chiton and the endemic shellfish locally called ‘churo.’ The residents of Floreana Island are directly dependent of these marine resources.

				"comment": "Freshwater is a limiting resource on Floreana Island, and the Galapagos Islands in general. The 140 residents, livestock, and wildlife are largely dependent on the health of just two freshwater springs. This project will help protect those springs by increasing vegetation cover across the island. This will convert eroded soils back into a “sponge,” causing the groundwater layers to rise rather than fall. Capture of sea-fog (locally known as ‘garua’) will be enhanced, resulting in more substantial precipitation. Additionally, increasing vegetation cover will reduce the temperature of the air column above the island, causing water vapour to condense, and thereby increasing rainfall. The net effect will be a positive increase in freshwater availability."

				"comment": "Removal of feral cats and invasive rodents will eliminate primary vectors of diseases on Floreana Island, helping to safeguard the health of the Floreana Island resident and tourist visitors.<br/><br/>Invasive alien rodents are often attracted to human-built infrastructure. They feed, chew holes, urinate, defecate and nest in areas occupied by people. The presence of rodents in commensal areas can lead to an increased risk of disease, including toxoplasmosis, lymphocytic clorio-meningitis, plague, leptospirosis, hantavirus, and salmonellosis. Once rodents are removed from commensal areas, the hygiene of a building and its contents can be better managed and human health secured.<br/><br/>Feral cats also serve as reservoirs and critical hosts of parasites and disease, and often live in the vicinity of human dwellings in order to take advantage of rodent populations and shelter. Cats carry several diseases in the Galapagos which can infect both humans and wildlife. For example, cats are the critical host for Toxoplasma gondii, which causes the disease toxoplasmosis. Most warm blooded animals are susceptible to toxoplasmosis infection. Toxoplasmosis is a threat to the endemic Galapagos fur seals (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) and the Galapagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki) found on Floreana Island, as well as the island’s human residents and visitors. Symptoms of toxoplasmosis in native fauna include poor coordination, blindness, lethargy, respiratory and enteric distress, and sudden death. In infected people, similar symptoms are exhibited. However, toxoplasmosis is best known as being a cause of spontaneous abortion in pregnant women.<br/>"

				"comment": "The recovery of Floreana Island ecosystems has the potential to increase tourist income to the benefit of the Floreana Island residents and other Ecuadorians. The ecological restoration of New Zealands’s Tiritiri Matangi Island provides an inspirational model.<br/><br/>In 1984, the small island of Tiritiri Matangi was a pastoral farm with sheep and cattle, and a small patch of remnant forest. Over the following  three decades, the community worked with the New Zealand Department of Conservation to replant native species and eradicate invasive alien rats and rabbits. These activities enabled native vegetation recovery and the reintroduction of a suite of endangered New Zealand wildlife. Free of the adverse impacts of invasive alien mammals, rare New Zealand birds and reptiles (species found few other places) began to thrive. Tiritiri Matangi Island is now one of the premier visitor sites in Auckland harbour. Although visitation is limited to 35,000 tourists a year, tourism activities on this island alone generated US$ 115,000,000 in 2013.   <br/><br/>The recently launched Floreana Island  community tourism initiative aims to equitably distribute the benefits of the tourism to the Floreana Island community. In order to minimize environmental impacts while facilitating economic opportunity, the total number of tourists will be reduced and the average time each visitor spends on the island (a shift from day-trips to overnight stays) increased, allowing for greater total income generation.  The project we propose herein supports these overarching goals. Like Tiritiri Matangi Island, Floreana Island will rely on its restored natural capital to attract national and international visitors who will pay premium prices for opportunities to see unique (and previously threatened) wildlife, generating significant income for Ecuador. <br/>"

These species are currently having direct and indirect adverse impacts on Floreana Island habitats. Permanent removal of these species will enable the recovery of habitat structure and function. <br/><br/>Direct impacts<br/>Rodents are opportunistic omnivores. Their adverse impacts on island habitats through plant and seed depredation have been well documented worldwide. A comparison of rat-infested and rat-free islands, as well as pre- and post-rat eradication experiments, clearly demonstrates that rats can depress the population size and recruitment of various native plants, altering forest structure, composition, and function. <br/><br/>Indirect impacts <br/>The impacts from invasive alien vertebrates, especially predatory mammals, are one of the leading causes of species extinction on islands. Rats and cats will predate a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate taxa. Invasive rodents will also feed on bird and reptile eggs. Population declines and/or the loss of native species can have cascading effects throughout the ecosystem, ultimately resulting in the loss of natural habitats. These indirect impacts are particularly dramatic when endemic vertebrates that play important roles in pollination, seed survival and dispersal, grazing, soil disturbance, and nutrient distribution are driven to extinction or near extinction.  Three examples of possible habitat-level impacts of invasive alien rodents and feral cats on Floreana Island habitats include:<br/><br/>   <ul><li>Predation on the IUCN Critically Endangered medium-tree finch (Camarhynchus pauper), a Floreana Island endemic,  could hinder seed dispersal across the Floreana Island landscape</li><br/>   <li>Because seabirds deliver large amounts of nutrients to terrestrial island systems through guano and food waste, predation on seabirds can reduce nutrient availability and thus depress primary production in insular plant communities and coastal marine productivity<li><br/>   <li>The inability to re-establish viable populations of the Floreana giant tortoise due to the predation of invasive mammals on tortoise eggs and hatchlings would prevent the recovery of habitats that evolved with the grazing pressure, seed scarification, and seed dispersal services that the tortoise once provided</li></ul><br/><br/>We intend to actively transfer ‘best practices’ to other human inhabited islands in Ecuador (e.g., Isla de la Plata) and islands worldwide.

At the request of Floreana Parish Council and other stakeholders, Island Conservation supported the Galapagos National Park in hosting a 5-day workshop in early 2014 for Floreana Island residents and institutional leaders to develop a holistic vision for Floreana Island and to explore needs and opportunities for conflict transformation in the context of environmental change. By request, Floreana Island residents will receive additional training in conflict transformation, as well as support for developing sustainable agriculture and ecotourism.<br/>Stakeholder consultations will be held in order to determine the most appropriate methodologies for invasive alien mammal eradication on Floreana, develop a pride campaign focused on island endemics, and identify needs and opportunities for strengthening the islands biosecurity programme. Floreana residents and island visitors will be empowered to take on leadership roles through this project.  For example, some island residents have already been trained in biological survey and data collection methodologies and are thus contributing vital information to project design.

It proposed four main conservation measures: (1) consolidate and strengthen the sustainability of production activities based on native biodiversity; (2) ensure the existence, integrity and functionality of all biodiversity components (ecosystems, species, genes); (3) balance pressures from conservation and sustainable use on biodiversity; and (4) guarantee the respect and exercise of individual and collective rights to participate in decisions related to access and control of resources, and ensure that the benefits derived from the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, as well as from the use of knowledge, innovations and practices of the indigenous communities and local populations, are justly and equitably distributed. <br/><br/>Due to the late timing of the approval (2007), as well as limits in legislation, institutional capacity, and funding, the Government of Ecuador has faced challenges in enacting the vision and activities set out in the NBSAP. As a result, the country’s initiatives have been strategically opportunistic, followed a ‘common sense’ approach, and engaged the direction and capacities of various private, public, and international organizations. Although not explicitly consistent with program of work set out in the NBSAP, numerous achievements in biodiversity conservation have been made, particularly in the Galapagos Archipelago.<br/><br/>The project proposed herein advances the four main conservation measures set out in the NBSAP by: a) protecting and restoring native ecosystems and b) securing the livelihoods of the people who depend on them. While the initial target location for the project is a single island (Floreana) in the Galapagos, we intend to transfer ‘best practices’ to other human-inhabited islands in Ecuador (e.g., Santa Cruz, San Cristobal, Isabela, Santay Islands) and beyond. Not only will this serve to support the objectives of Ecuador’s first NBSAP, it will enable other governments to advance NBSAP objectives as well.<br/><br/>Ecuador recently submitted its 5th National Report to the CBD (http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/ec/ec-nr-05-es.pdf), describing the country’s current and future progress towards achieving the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in conjunction with the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020. We consider strategic and timely actions to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change and invasive alien species to be urgent conservation needs. This project’s specific contributions toward achieving the Aichi Biodiversity Target are described later in this proposal.<br/><br/>The Government of Ecuador released a report on its activities to implement the CBD Programme of Work on Protected Areas in 2012 (‘Plan de Acción para la Implementación del Programa de Trabajo sobre Áreas Protegidas de la Convención sobre la Diversidad Biológica; https://www.cbd.int/doc/world/ec/ec-nbsap-powpa-es.pdf ). Ecuador has a strong commitment to not only establishing protected areas, but ensuring that they do, in fact, convey long-term protection to biodiversity and the people who rely on natural resources for their livelihoods and well-being.  Approximately 1/3 (32%) of Ecuador’s terrestrial and marine environments have been afforded legal protection status; 47 of these are described in the report to the CBD, including the Galapagos Islands. This project will support implementation of Ecuador’s protected areas plan by: a) helping to ensure that the biodiversity of Floreana Island is protected in accordance with the multiple protected area designations held by the Galapagos Islands, b) integrating local peoples into protected area planning and implementation, and c) building the capacity of protected area managers and local people on other Ecuadorian islands (e.g., Isla de la Plata) to achieve conservation through the removal of invasive alien species and recovery of endemic species.",

					"description": "This project seeks to restore island ecosystems and secure human livelihoods by eradicating invasive alien species and re-establishing locally extinct species. Project success will facilitate climate change resilience on human-inhabited islands in Ecuador and beyond.<br/><br/>Ecuador is one of the 17 megadiverse countries in the world. Main threats to the country’s biodiversity include deforestation, invasive alien species, natural resource extraction, and climate change. Ecuador recently submitted its 5th National Report to the CBD, describing the country’s current and future progress towards achieving the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in conjunction the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 (5th National Report: https://www.cbd.int/reports/nr5/). Strategic and timely actions to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change and invasive alien species are conservation imperatives.<br/><br/>The Galapagos Islands are among the ‘jewels’ of Ecuador and a top conservation priority; their rich, endemic biodiversity (>95% of species extant) draws substantial nature-based tourist income (@US$1 billion/year). In order to facilitate protection of its unique biodiversity, Ecuador created the Galapagos National Park in 1959 and designated the Galapagos Marine Reserve in 1996. In acknowledgment of their global conservation value, the Galapagos Islands became the first World Heritage Site in 1978 and were designated as a UNESCO-Man and Biosphere Reserve in 1984. However, largely due to threats posed by invasive alien species, UNESCO listed the Galapagos Islands as a World Heritage Site in Danger in 2007. Because they are inhabited by endemic species that persist on a single island complex, Floreana Island and two of its satellite islands have recently been identified as an Alliance for Zero Extinction site (http://www.zeroextinction.org/).<br/><br/>This proposed project focuses on the ecological restoration and long-term protection of Floreana Island, a 173 km2 human-inhabited island in the Galapagos Archipelago, which hosts 54 IUCN Red Listed species (10 Critically Endangered, 18 Endangered, and 26 Vulnerable species), the world’s largest Galapagos petrel (Pterodroma phaeopygia) breeding colony, and 11 nesting seabird species. <br/><br/>Whalers began visiting Floreana Island regularly in the late 1700s. Floreana Island was the first Galapagos island to be settled (1832), and is now home to 140 people who rely on nature-based tourism, farming, and fisheries for their livelihood. Due to the long history of human activity, Floreana Island has experienced the most significant habitat degradation and highest level of species loss of any island in the Galapagos. Over the past 300 years at least 12 native species have been extirpated from the island, largely due to the adverse impacts of invasive alien species [the exceptions being the Floreana giant tortoise (Chelonoidis elephantopus and Galapagos hawk (Buteo galapagoensis) which were also overharvested]. Four native species have become locally extinct in just the last 30 years. <br/><br/>Ecuadorian conservation agencies and non-governmental organizations, as well as the people of Floreana Island, currently share a strong interest in the repatriation of two of Floreana Island’s endemic species: the Floreana mockingbird (Mimus trifasciatus) and Floreana giant tortoise (Chelonoidis elephantopus).<br/><br/>The Floreana mockingbird is included on the IUCN Red List as a Critically Endangered species due to the small size of the remaining population (85-231 individuals) and tendency of the population size to fluctuate with extreme weather events. In 2007, a particularly dry year on Floreana Island, the total global population of Floreana mockingbirds declined to 46 adults. The species became extinct on Floreana Island between 1868 and 1880, and can now only be found on two rodent- and cat-free satellite islets off Floreana Island’s coast, Champion (0.1 km2) and Gardner-by-Floreana (0.8 km2). The status of the Floreana mockingbird is monitored on an annual basis.<br/><br/>For approximately 150 years, the Floreana giant tortoise was thought to have been driven to extinction by human harvesting and invasive alien species (e.g., rats and cats that prey on hatchling tortoises). However, genetic studies recently revealed that the Floreana giant tortoise still persists in the wild on the northern end of the island of Isabela, a few hundred kilometers from its place of origin on Floreana Island.  The tortoises were likely released on Isabela Island by seafarers who had collected them on Floreana Island for food. These findings provide great hope for recovery of this species, as well as the other native species that depended on its services as a herbivore and seed disperser. A few individuals of the species now constitute the nucleus of a small captive breeding population being led by the Galapagos National Park Directorate on Santa Cruz Island. <br/><br/>Feral goats (Capra hircus) were successfully removed from Floreana Island in 2007 by the Galapagos National Park Directorate in collaboration with the Floreana Parish Council. However, feral cats (Felis catus)  and invasive alien rats (Rattus rattus) and mice (Mus musculus) remain a threat to biodiversity and people. The eradication of invasive alien species from Floreana Island will not only enable the recovery of individual species, it will facilitate ecosystem recovery and resilience to environmental change. Ecuador’s National Climate Change Plan (2013) promotes ecosystem-based approaches (e.g., invasive alien species eradication) to climate mitigation. <br/><br/>Eradicating invasive alien species to build resilience to climate change is as much a socio-cultural issue as it is an ecological issue. The residents of Floreana Island recognize that they are being negatively impacted by invasive alien species (e.g., through crop losses, disease risk transmission) and that they are highly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change (e.g., extreme weather events). The Floreana Parish Council has requested support from the Government of Ecuador and its partners to help safeguard their future. This project will help meet their needs by increasing food and income security (especially from tourism), eliminating disease risks, and fostering community cohesion and empowerment through training in conflict transformation and implementation of a campaign intended to build pride in the island’s endemic species (hereafter ‘pride campaign’).<br/><br/>Recognizing the value to biodiversity conservation and human livelihoods, invasive alien vertebrate eradications have already been successfully completed on 1,100 islands worldwide, the vast majority of which are uninhabited (http://diise.islandconservation.org/). Approximately 50% of IUCN Critically Endangered and Endangered island-based mammals, reptiles, and amphibians exist on islands that also have human populations greater than 10,000 people (http://tib.islandconservation.org/). There is a clear and immediate need to advance innovative approaches and tools to eradicate invasive alien vertebrates on human-inhabited islands. Success of the Floreana Island project proposed herein will set a global precedent, enabling new climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation projects on hundreds of human-inhabited islands in Ecuador, and across the world. <br/><br/>Summary of Threats and Opportunities<br/><ul><br/><li>Invasive alien species (eradicate invasive alien rodents and feral cats; strengthen biosecurity program)</li><br/><li>Climate change (restore and protect island ecosystems; build social resilience through training in conflict transformation and a community-empowering pride campaign)</li><br/><li>Extirpation of endemic species (reintroduce Floreana mockingbird and Floreana giant tortoise post-rodent and feral cat eradication)</li><br/></ul>",

					"description": "This project seeks to restore island ecosystems and secure human livelihoods by eradicating invasive alien species and re-establishing locally extinct species. Project success will facilitate climate change resilience on human-inhabited islands in Ecuador and beyond.<br/><br/>Ecuador is one of the 17 megadiverse countries in the world. Main threats to the country’s biodiversity include deforestation, invasive alien species, natural resource extraction, and climate change. Ecuador recently submitted its 5th National Report to the CBD, describing the country’s current and future progress towards achieving the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in conjunction the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 (5th National Report: https://www.cbd.int/reports/nr5/). Strategic and timely actions to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change and invasive alien species are conservation imperatives.<br/><br/>The Galapagos Islands are among the ‘jewels’ of Ecuador and a top conservation priority; their rich, endemic biodiversity (>95% of species extant) draws substantial nature-based tourist income (@US$1 billion/year). In order to facilitate protection of its unique biodiversity, Ecuador created the Galapagos National Park in 1959 and designated the Galapagos Marine Reserve in 1996. In acknowledgment of their global conservation value, the Galapagos Islands became the first World Heritage Site in 1978 and were designated as a UNESCO-Man and Biosphere Reserve in 1984. However, largely due to threats posed by invasive alien species, UNESCO listed the Galapagos Islands as a World Heritage Site in Danger in 2007. Because they are inhabited by endemic species that persist on a single island complex, Floreana Island and two of its satellite islands have recently been identified as an Alliance for Zero Extinction site (http://www.zeroextinction.org/).<br/><br/>This proposed project focuses on the ecological restoration and long-term protection of Floreana Island, a 173 km2 human-inhabited island in the Galapagos Archipelago, which hosts 54 IUCN Red Listed species (10 Critically Endangered, 18 Endangered, and 26 Vulnerable species), the world’s largest Galapagos petrel (Pterodroma phaeopygia) breeding colony, and 11 nesting seabird species. <br/><br/>Whalers began visiting Floreana Island regularly in the late 1700s. Floreana Island was the first Galapagos island to be settled (1832), and is now home to 140 people who rely on nature-based tourism, farming, and fisheries for their livelihood. Due to the long history of human activity, Floreana Island has experienced the most significant habitat degradation and highest level of species loss of any island in the Galapagos. Over the past 300 years at least 12 native species have been extirpated from the island, largely due to the adverse impacts of invasive alien species [the exceptions being the Floreana giant tortoise (Chelonoidis elephantopus and Galapagos hawk (Buteo galapagoensis) which were also overharvested]. Four native species have become locally extinct in just the last 30 years. <br/><br/>Ecuadorian conservation agencies and non-governmental organizations, as well as the people of Floreana Island, currently share a strong interest in the repatriation of two of Floreana Island’s endemic species: the Floreana mockingbird (Mimus trifasciatus) and Floreana giant tortoise (Chelonoidis elephantopus).<br/><br/>The Floreana mockingbird is included on the IUCN Red List as a Critically Endangered species due to the small size of the remaining population (85-231 individuals) and tendency of the population size to fluctuate with extreme weather events. In 2007, a particularly dry year on Floreana Island, the total global population of Floreana mockingbirds declined to 46 adults. The species became extinct on Floreana Island between 1868 and 1880, and can now only be found on two rodent- and cat-free satellite islets off Floreana Island’s coast, Champion (0.1 km2) and Gardner-by-Floreana (0.8 km2). The status of the Floreana mockingbird is monitored on an annual basis.<br/><br/>For approximately 150 years, the Floreana giant tortoise was thought to have been driven to extinction by human harvesting and invasive alien species (e.g., rats and cats that prey on hatchling tortoises). However, genetic studies recently revealed that the Floreana giant tortoise still persists in the wild on the northern end of the island of Isabela, a few hundred kilometers from its place of origin on Floreana Island.  The tortoises were likely released on Isabela Island by seafarers who had collected them on Floreana Island for food. These findings provide great hope for recovery of this species, as well as the other native species that depended on its services as a herbivore and seed disperser. A few individuals of the species now constitute the nucleus of a small captive breeding population being led by the Galapagos National Park Directorate on Santa Cruz Island. <br/><br/>Feral goats (Capra hircus) were successfully removed from Floreana Island in 2007 by the Galapagos National Park Directorate in collaboration with the Floreana Parish Council. However, feral cats (Felis catus)  and invasive alien rats (Rattus rattus) and mice (Mus musculus) remain a threat to biodiversity and people. The eradication of invasive alien species from Floreana Island will not only enable the recovery of individual species, it will facilitate ecosystem recovery and resilience to environmental change. Ecuador’s National Climate Change Plan (2013) promotes ecosystem-based approaches (e.g., invasive alien species eradication) to climate mitigation. <br/><br/>Eradicating invasive alien species to build resilience to climate change is as much a socio-cultural issue as it is an ecological issue.

The species became extinct on Floreana Island between 1868 and 1880, and can now only be found on two rodent- and cat-free satellite islets off Floreana Island’s coast, Champion (0.1 km2) and Gardner-by-Floreana (0.8 km2). The status of the Floreana mockingbird is monitored on an annual basis.<br/><br/>For approximately 150 years, the Floreana giant tortoise was thought to have been driven to extinction by human harvesting and invasive alien species (e.g., rats and cats that prey on hatchling tortoises). However, genetic studies recently revealed that the Floreana giant tortoise still persists in the wild on the northern end of the island of Isabela, a few hundred kilometers from its place of origin on Floreana Island.  The tortoises were likely released on Isabela Island by seafarers who had collected them on Floreana Island for food. These findings provide great hope for recovery of this species, as well as the other native species that depended on its services as a herbivore and seed disperser. A few individuals of the species now constitute the nucleus of a small captive breeding population being led by the Galapagos National Park Directorate on Santa Cruz Island. <br/><br/>Feral goats (Capra hircus) were successfully removed from Floreana Island in 2007 by the Galapagos National Park Directorate in collaboration with the Floreana Parish Council. However, feral cats (Felis catus)  and invasive alien rats (Rattus rattus) and mice (Mus musculus) remain a threat to biodiversity and people. The eradication of invasive alien species from Floreana Island will not only enable the recovery of individual species, it will facilitate ecosystem recovery and resilience to environmental change. Ecuador’s National Climate Change Plan (2013) promotes ecosystem-based approaches (e.g., invasive alien species eradication) to climate mitigation. <br/><br/>Eradicating invasive alien species to build resilience to climate change is as much a socio-cultural issue as it is an ecological issue. The residents of Floreana Island recognize that they are being negatively impacted by invasive alien species (e.g., through crop losses, disease risk transmission) and that they are highly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change (e.g., extreme weather events). The Floreana Parish Council has requested support from the Government of Ecuador and its partners to help safeguard their future. This project will help meet their needs by increasing food and income security (especially from tourism), eliminating disease risks, and fostering community cohesion and empowerment through training in conflict transformation and implementation of a campaign intended to build pride in the island’s endemic species (hereafter ‘pride campaign’).<br/><br/>Recognizing the value to biodiversity conservation and human livelihoods, invasive alien vertebrate eradications have already been successfully completed on 1,100 islands worldwide, the vast majority of which are uninhabited (http://diise.islandconservation.org/). Approximately 50% of IUCN Critically Endangered and Endangered island-based mammals, reptiles, and amphibians exist on islands that also have human populations greater than 10,000 people (http://tib.islandconservation.org/). There is a clear and immediate need to advance innovative approaches and tools to eradicate invasive alien vertebrates on human-inhabited islands. Success of the Floreana Island project proposed herein will set a global precedent, enabling new climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation projects on hundreds of human-inhabited islands in Ecuador, and across the world. <br/><br/>Summary of Threats and Opportunities<br/><ul><br/><li>Invasive alien species (eradicate invasive alien rodents and feral cats; strengthen biosecurity program)</li><br/><li>Climate change (restore and protect island ecosystems; build social resilience through training in conflict transformation and a community-empowering pride campaign)</li><br/><li>Extirpation of endemic species (reintroduce Floreana mockingbird and Floreana giant tortoise post-rodent and feral cat eradication)</li><br/></ul>",

The main factor and the most negative impacts on the park has been the human activity, over-exploitation of natural resources especially forests and the negative impacting on the entire ecosystem. Being an important area of special biodiversity values this sites’ rehabilitation and integrated management is a priority in the wider context of achieving the sustainable use and conservation of natural resources to be able to reach Aichi targets of the CBD.",
		"description": "National Park Lura is designated since 1996, by a Governmente Decree no. 96, dated 21.11.1996 as Forest national park, with an area of 1280 hectares. National Park “Lura”, is situated in Dibra Qark (county), in Dibra District and in Lura Commune. <br/>It is considered amongst the rarely and special beauty of Albanian’s nature. It has high scientific, tourism, recreation, economic and social value; an international biodiversity value, diverse habitats, vegetation types and animal species, and a variety of ecosystems as natural forests, meadow and glacier lakes.<br/><br/>The project goal is to rehabilitate and ensure integrated management of Lura National Park, to protect biodiversity and natural specific characteristics and unique values of habitats and species of flora and fauna, representative qualities, aesthetic and historical and cultural use territory sustainable, tourism, research and opportunities to educate and raise awareness, by integrating them with the ecological, economic, social and cultural goals.<br/><br/>Among major activities of the project will be the design of the rehabilitation plan and implementation of this plan.<br/><br/>Thus, forests and vegetation are cut and burned several times, habitats and species of flora and fauna are destroyed, altered or highly vulnerable to extinction, some water sources have dried up, are impinged water surfaces of lakes, etc., hence erosion is advancing and growing. These phenomena and human activities are leading to the devaluation of natural, biological and eco-touristic park and beyond.<br/><br/>Preservation of Protected Areas is an obligation of Albania from the national legal framework and international commitments in the field of nature conservation and biodiversity. As a party to a number of international conventions, Albania has its obligation and responsibility to meet such demands. Through the implementation of this project it will be aimed simultaneously the increase of living standard of the population, promoting the sustainable development of the environment and natural and cultural resources and achieving the objectives, policies of the EU,  as well as national and local ones. Improving the situation in the park territory is more than necessary at the moment<br/>Based on the relief, geographical position and climatic conditions, livestock and farming are not considered as developed, although people have a tradition on these. Economic and social development generally relies on traditional management of many natural resources of the area.<br/><br/>The park's vegetation consists mainly of beech, fir and Macedonian pine, represenatives of the Alpine area. In this area there are different coniferous and vegetation gatherings, that makes this mountain massive important in terms of biodiversity values of Albania such as beech (Fagus silvatica), Pine (Pinus heldreichii), Fir (Abies alba), Black pine (Pinus nigra) and sometimes European yew (Taxus baccata), are examples of shrubs Daphne (Daphne mezereum), blueberries (Vaccinium myrtilius) and heather (Erica carnea).<br/><br/>The combination of floristic values with those of landscape make the park and other areas around it, from the environmental point of view, one of the famous ecosystems in comparison with other mountain ecosystems of the country.<br/><br/>Within the Park’s territory there are famous lakes such as: Flower Lake, Black Lake, Grand Lake,which are also declared Nature Monuments (Cat. III IUCN).<br/>Lura is known for wild fauna diversity. In the Parks‘ massive find shelter many species of mammals such as the hedgehog (Erinaceus europeus), mole (Talpa europea), Bats (Chiroptera), Forest Mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), squirrel (Sciurius vulgaris), lynx (Lynx lynx), otter (Lutra lutra), Brown bear (Ursus arctos) etc.<br/><br/>The park’s fauna is typical for the mountainous area. The main species occurring there are bear (Ursus actos), wolf (Canis lupus), lynx (Felis lynx), wild goat (Rupicapra rupicapra), roebuck (Capreolus capreolus), wild boar (Sus scrofa) etc. The birds are represented by the eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), capercaille (Tatrao urogallus), falcon (Falco sp), etc. The reptiles and amphibians include the beauty of the land (Salamandra salamandra), the alpine’s triton, the yellow belly frog, the wood frog, the arrow and big water snake etc. The park has also many picturesque landscapes. The strong glacial activity has brought the creation of circuses and glacial lakes surrounded by high mountains covered by meadows and forests, with amazing views, and important species as the water lily (Nymphaea alba and Nymiphaea luteum), with a white into yellow color. A magnificent and contemplative view has also the Pela’s highlands field, with a variegated flora, multi-colored flowers and surrounded with centennial woods. Also, the water resources are amazing, including creeks, the canyons and permanent and temporary waterfalls. Apart the economic and scientific value, the park has great aesthetic, landscape and tourism values preferred by the local and foreign visitors. Natures and biological richness, the landscape beauties offers great potential for the eco-tourism’s development, as a very important resource for the income generation of local communities, which mainly takes care of stock-breeding. In proximity of the park are located the villages of Fushë-Lurë, Gurrë-Lurë, etc, very picturesque and appropriate for traditional activities and products requested by the visitors and tourist. The inhabitants in general take care for agriculture, forestry, stock-breeding and handcrafts production. Many of the richest nature resources are not used by the community for the familiar tourism and cultural development. The park is not very visited by the visitors because of the damaged infrastructure and for the lack of the services. The economic and social conditions have forced the inhabitants to leave, which is not in the park’s administration interest and not good for the development of the tourism.",

		"summary": "Depuis les années 1960 à ce jour, la Côte d’Ivoire a réalisé 8 Parcs nationaux couvrant une superficie totale de 1.732.100 ha, 5 réserves naturelles qui couvrent 339 630 hectares et 16 réserves botaniques d’une superficie de 198 418 hectares. A ces lieux privilégiés de conservation in situ que sont les aires protégées terrestres s’ajoutent 231 forêts classées de 4.200 000 hectares dont certaines sont particulièrement riches, 6.702 forêts sacrées de 36.434 ha et depuis 2009, 6 sites Ramsars. Cependant, le pays ne dispose d’aucune aire marine protégée. Le présent Projet, fait partie d’un réseau d’Aires Marines Protégées à réaliser en Côte d’Ivoire et porte sur la création de la première aire marine protégée ivoirienne, premier maillon du dit réseau. Avec une superficie de 2500 ha (25 Km²), l’AMP proposée est localisée dans les eaux marines côtières de la région d’Assinie en face du contact Mer-lagune Abyet constitue un redimensionnement du Parc National des îles Ehotilé (550 ha). L’AMP des îles Ehotilé proposée a pour but de contribuer à la conservation de la diversité biologique marine, à la durabilité du bien-être des populations riveraines dont l’activité principale est axée sur les pêcheries et surtout à contribuer à l’atteinte des objectifs d’AICHI en ce qui concerne la conservation de 10% des milieux marins d’ici 2020.",
		"description": "Depuis 1926, les actions de l’État visant la sauvegarde de la diversité biologique ont permis de créer à partir de sites naturels un important réseau d’aires protégées. Ainsi, le pays dispose de 8 Parcs nationaux couvrant une superficie totale de 1.732.100 ha, 5 réserves naturelles qui couvrent 339 630 hectares et 16 réserves botaniques d’une superficie de 198 418 hectares. A ces lieux privilégiés de conservation in situ que sont les aires protégées (légalement) s’ajoutent 231 forêts classées de 4.200 000 hectares dont certaines sont particulièrement riches et 6.702 forêts sacrées de 36.434 ha dont le mode de conservation intègre les valeurs traditionnelles des populations locales.<br/><br/>En somme, la Côte d’Ivoire dispose de Parcs et réserves terrestres dont des aires lagunaires et des zones humides protégées (six zones Ramsar) mais elle ne dispose pas au « sens strict» d’aires marines protégées, alors que le pays dispose d’une zone côtière qui s’étend sur une superficie de 32 960 Km2 dont la diversité biologique est exceptionnelle.<br/><br/>La diversité biologique aquatique les écosystèmes et les habitats dont les plus remarquables sont les embouchures des principaux cours d’eau, les lagunes, les mangroves, les habitats de sable sur le littoral, les rochers, le plateau continental, les habitats de sédiments, les eaux marines côtières, les habitats de végétaux marins etc. Les macrophytes marins (30 espèces), les invertébrés (+ de 400 espècesles poissons (environ 300 espèces), les mammifères dominés par les cétacés (baleines et dauphin) et les lamantins avec une dizaine d’espèces, les tortues marines (6 espèces) et les oiseaux.<br/><br/>Cette diversité biologique marine subit des pressions d’origine tellurique et maritime, il apparait aujourd’hui indispensable d’établir un réseau d’Aires Marines protégées, afin d’assurer la sauvegarde de cette biodiversité unique sur l’ensemble du territoire national.<br/><br/>Le Parc National des Iles Ehotilés créé en 1974 (décret de classement n°74-179 du 25 avril 1974), s’étend sur 550 ha. Il est situé au Sud de la lagune Aby, au sein du complexe Ehotilé – Essouman, comprenant un ensemble de neuf îles reparties dans un Delta allant de la lagune Tendo au Sud-Ouest à la localité d’Assinie mafia au sud-Est. Le cordon littoral associé est une barrière pour le complexe des lagunes Aby, Tendo et Ehy. Il est arrosé par des cours d’eau notamment la Bia et la Tanoé et comprend la terre ferme, des forêts ripicoles et marécageuses, des fourrées et des mangroves. Le complexe abrite une faune diversifiée du fait de sa situation privilégiée entre le milieu continental et les étendues océaniques. La faune aviaire est riche de 143 espèces, la faune reptilienne compte 5 espèces remarquables, la faune ichtyologique est la plus abondante du littoral. L’on relève que la diversité biocénotique jointe à la nette prédominance des mécanismes d’endozoochorie et d’épizoochorie pour la reproduction de la flore du bloc guinéen constitue une source du maintien de la diversité biologique et écologique dans ce site.<br/><br/>Cette biodiversité est menacée par divers phénomènes anthropiques ou non, dont les conséquences sont le déclin qualitatif et quantitatif de l’ichtyofaune et l’exploitation anarchique des ressources biologiques.<br/><br/>Aujourd’hui, la pêche aux crevettes demeure dynamique en lagune, mais elle n’est plus exercée en 5 mer en raison de la réduction drastique des prises dont la commercialisation ne permet aucun retour sur investissement ; cette situation témoigne de:<br/><br/><ul><li>l’incertitude concernant l’état de l’écosystème, son intégrité (variation dans la composition des communautés, vulnérabilité des espèces, introduction d’espèces étrangères), et son rendement dans un environnement hautement variable incluant les effets des changements climatiques ;</li><li>la détérioration de la qualité de l’eau (chronique et catastrophique) due aux activités telluriques et marines, eutrophisation et proliférations algales ; et</li><li>la destruction et altération des habitats qui incluent entre autres les modifications des fonds marins et de la zone côtière, dégradation des paysages côtiers et l’érosion côtière.</li></ul><br/><br/>Par ailleurs, l’on assiste, ces dernières années, à d’intenses activités d’exploration et d’exploitation pétrolière et gazière tout le long du littoral ivoirien, qui a intégralement fait l’objet de délimitation en blocs pétroliers de la part des services compétents du secteur des mines et de l’énergie ; toutes choses qui incitent à la définition en urgence d’un espace marin protégé pour la protection de la diversité biologique marine.<br/><br/>Le Projet consiste à étendre l’actuel Parc national des ïles Ehotilés, dont la superficie est de 550 ha, essentiellement en milieu terrestre, à 2500 ha en vue d’y inclure une partie des eaux marines et côtières. Les finalités visées à travers la création de l’AMP sont:<br/><ul> <li> Le bon état des espèces et habitats à statut particulier, patrimoniaux ou méritant de l’être ;</li> <li> Le bon état des espèces et habitats hors statut (espèces halieutiques exploitées, espèces<br> très abondante localement donnant une responsabilité biogéographique du site) ;</li> <li>Le rendu de fonctions écologiques clefs (frayères, nourriceries, nurseries, productivité, repos,<br> alimentation, migration, route des sardines) ;</li> <li>Le bon état des eaux marines (la qualité et la santé des eaux) </li> <li> L’exploitation durable des ressources vivantes et non vivantes (ressources halieutiques) ;</li> <li>Le développement durable des usages (Pêche, éco-tourisme) ;</li> <li>Le maintien du patrimoine maritime culturel (sites sacrés).</li> </ul><br/>Pour y parvenir, le projet devra mettre en oeuvre un certain nombre d’activités, notamment:<br/><br/><ol> <li> La mise en place du cadre de gouvernance du projet: <ul> <li>Equipe de mise en oeuvre </li> <li>Comité d’orientation et de suivi du processus</li> <li>Comités paritaires incluant populations, acteurs économiques et autorités locales </li> </ul></li> <li> La mise en oeuvre des procédures administratives telles que : <ul><li>la mise en protection temporaire, et</li> <li>la création définitive de l’AMP </li></ul> </li> <li> La conduite des études : <ul><li>Etat des lieux </li> <li>Etudes d’impact environnemental simplifiée puis, détaillée</li> <li>Schéma et plan d’aménagement</li> <li>Plan de gestion</li> <li>Cartes d’occupation du sol et thématiques à différentes échelles </li></ul> </li> </ol><ul> <li>Concertations et consultations </li> <ul> <li>a.

		"ecological_contribution": "<p>- Le pays dispose d’un réseau de parcs et réserves dont la vocation est de représenter l’ensemble des écosystèmes et habitats du territoire. Aujourd’hui, les différents biomes sont pratiquement tous couverts. Le réseau comprend des Parcs et réserves terrestres dans lesquels sont inclus des aires lagunaires et des zones humides protégées (six zones Ramsar) mais ne dispose pas d’aires marines protégées alors que le pays dispose d’une zone côtière qui s’étend sur une superficie de 32 960 Km2 et dont la diversité biologique est exceptionnelle. - Les îles Ehotilé-Essouman font partie du système lagunaire Est Ivoirien qui constitue le deuxième système du point de vue de la superficie (427 km2). Ce système est le « plus continental » des systèmes lagunaires Ivoiriens. Il offre une grande variété de milieux : mangrove ; forêt marécageuse ; marais ; plan d’eau lagunaire ; réseau d’eau douce, etc. Ces milieux constituent des zones privilégiées pour l’alimentation des poissons. </p><br/><p>- Le site présente des eaux marines qui sont en bonne santé et de bonne qualité. C’est le lieu de passage des upwellings côtiers en provenance du Ghana sous l’effet du courant du Golfe de Guinée et sous l’effet du contre-courant de guinée les eaux marines côtières sont véhiculées vers le Ghana. La période des upwellings est marquée par une intense activité biologique dans les eaux marines côtières. Les eaux riches en éléments nutritifs du fond sont ramenées à la surface et cela favorise la production et la productivité du phytoplancton. Le major upwelling coïncide avec la période de reproduction de Sardinellaaurita (clupeidae), une espèce très importante pour les pêcheries locales. S. aurita consomme essentiellement le zooplancton Calanoidescarinatus et ce dernier est abondant lors du phénomène de « major upwelling ». De plus, les captures de poisons sont nettement plus importantes durant le « major » upwelling que lors du « minor » upwelling. </p><br/><p>- La région communique avec la lagune Aby à travers le Canal d’Assinie (carte). De ce fait, on assiste à la migration en lagune ou vice versa des espèces amphidromiques comme les crevettes roses Penaeusnotialis, les crevettes grises PenaeusKerathurus, les stomatopodesSquillaMantis, les ethmalosesEthmalosafimbriata et les mulets.</p> <br/><hr><ul> <li>Le complexe Ehotilé-Essouman est un lieu privilégié de nidification de la tortue verte (Cheloniamydas). Les femelles pondent dans des nids sur les plages. </li> <li>Une bonne proportion de l’avifaune nidifie sur ce site, notamment la sarcelle à oreillons (Nettapusauritus), le cormoran africain (Phalacrocorax africanus), la cigogne épiscoplale (Ciconiaepiscopus), etc. </li> <li>C’est un lieu de refuge pour les oiseaux soumis à la chasse sportive dans les milieux adjacents à la zone humide.  Le complexe Eholié-Essouman sert de refuge à la communauté de chiroptères (CHIROPTERA) intensément braconnée vers les secteurs plus à l’ouest. </li> <li> La zone offre des refuges à de nombreuses espèces de la faune aquatique durant une partie ou la totalité de leur cycle. C’est le cas du tilapia (Tilapia sp), des huîtres (Crassostreagasar) ainsi que de nombreux gastéropodes (GASTEROPODA), des crevettes (ex. Penaeusnotialis) dans leur phase juvénile et de poissons de mer. 10 </li> <li> A Ehotilé-Essouman, l’abondance des crabes fouisseurs, surtout sur les substrats vaseux favorise la présence du groupe des périophtalmes. De vastes groupes de poissons marins échouent sur le site au gré des vagues et profitent des éléments nutritifs apportés par un système fluvial plutôt dense. Les activités fréquentes de dragage au niveau de l’embouchure de la Comoé à une quarantaine de kilomètre à l’ouest provoquent des déplacements saisonniers des bancs de poissons vers le littoral au niveau du site.  Ehotilé-Essouman est une zone importante de frayère et d’alevinage. Il est localisé entre l’embouchure du fleuve Comoé à l’ouest (très urbanisé : villes et infrastructures) et du sous système lagunaire Ehy-Tendo à l’est (très anthropisé dans son bassin versant : plantations industrielles de palmier et de cocotier). Le complexe offre des conditions adéquates pour la reproduction des poissons. </li> <li> Ehotilé-Essouman abrite des espèces de mammifères et d’oiseaux reconnus comme des bioindicateurs de premier ordre (SODEFOR-GTZ, Abengourou, 1995). C’est le cas de l’éléphant de forêt (Loxodontaafricanacyclotis) ; du potamochère (potamochoerusporcus) ; du chimpanzé (pan troglodytes verus) ; du touraco géant (Corythaeolacristata) et du touraco à gros bec (Toracomacrorhynchus). </li> </ul><br/>Le complexe Ehotilé-Essouman abrite une faune assez diversifiée du fait de sa situation privilégiée entre le milieu continental et le milieu océanique et à la diversité des conditions édaphiques.<ul> <li>La faune aviaire est riche de plus de 143 espèces. On y trouve des oiseaux d’eau (Podicepsruficollis (Grèbe castagneux), Anhinga rufa (Anhinga d’Afrique), Phalacrocorax africanus (Cormoran africain), Ardeola ibis (Héron garde boeuf), Ardeolaralloides (Héron crabier), Butoridesstriatus (Héron à dos vert), Egrettagularis (Aigrette dimorphe). Nycticoraxnycticorax (Héron bihoreau), Ciconiaepiscopus (Cigogne épiscopale), Dendrocygnaviduata (Dendrocygne veuve), ec. Des oiseaux migrateurs (Milvusmigrans (Milan noir), Halcyon leucocephala (Martin chasseur à tête grise), Apus affinis (Martinet à dos blanc), Treronaustralis (Pigeon vert à font nu), Haliaetusvocifer (Aigle pêcheur), Ardea cinerea (héron cendré, Egrettagarzetta (Aigrette garzette), Pandion haliaetus (Balbusard pêcheur), etc.. </li> <li>L’abondance des chauves-souris (chiroptère) est remarquable. C’est une particularité sur tout le long du littoral Sud Est.  La faune reptilienne est tout aussi significative quoique moins abondante en comparaison de celle des oiseaux : Atractaspis SP (Serpent minute) ; Causus Rhombeatus (Vipère causus) ; Graiya Smithi (serpent de Smith) ; Naja melanoleuca (faux cracheur). </li> <li> La faune aquatique notamment celle des poissons est l’une des plus abondante du littoral ivoirien : Elopslacerta (Guinée copace) ; Albula vulpes (banane de mer) ; Dasyatismargarita (Pastenague marguerite) ; Liza falcipinis (Mulet à grandes nageoires) ; quelques animaux plus ou moins inféodés aux zones humides ; Trichechussenegalensis; Lutramaculicolis (Loutre à cou tâcheté) ; Aonyxcapensis (Loutre à joues blanches).</li> </ul>",

Cette régulation est liée au fait que dans ces forêts toutes les niches écologiques sont occupées par des plantes (grands arbres, arbustes, lianes, etc.). Cet ensemble constitue un « écran » protecteur contre certains évènements violents tels que les vents et les tornades. Cette situation est nette dans la région deltaïque d’Assinie où l’on compte réaliser l’aire marine protégée. En effet, situées en face du Canal d’Assinie et formant un delta, les Iles Ehotilés contribuent à la gestion des entrées et des sorties d’eaux marines et de ce fait participent à la dynamique des eaux dans la région y compris la dynamique côtière.

Ces dernières, apparaissent durant les saisons de pluie, de crues et de postcrues et comme elles ne sont pas fixées, elles sont véhiculées à travers tous les habitats aquatiques de la région. Ces plantes, constituent un véritable écran, en tapis dense, qui modifie l’hydrodynamisme et les échanges atmosphères-milieux aquatiques. De ce fait, elles contribuent à la dégradation de l’eau et constituent une nuisance au point où elles freinent l’activité de pêche durant une période de l’année. Le phénomène concerne les eaux marines côtières de la région d’Assinie au Ghana. Dans ce cadre, les deux pays ont mis en place un comité scientifique et ont soumis un projet commun de contrôle/gestion des macrophytes envahissantes à leur gouvernement respectif.</p> "

		"summary": "The project seeks to harness Prosopis Juliflora for improved livelihoods and restoration of fragile ecosystems whose existence has been threatened by the plant through invasion of water ways, habitable, grazing and arable land leading to loss of both biodiversity and livelihood in Kenya’s ASALs.",
		"description": "The project seeks to harness Prosopis Juliflora for improved livelihoods and restoration of fragile ecosystems whose existence has been threatened by the plant through invasion of water ways, habitable, grazing and arable land leading to loss of both biodiversity and livelihood in Kenya’s ASALs. <br/><br/>Prosopis Juliflora is an invasive plant species which was introduced in Kenya to rehabilitate degraded dry-lands. Prosopis or ‘Mathenge’ as it is commonly known locally, is an evergreen, fast growing, nitrogen-fixing plant that is tolerant to arid conditions and saline soils. The plant is also known to survive where other tree species have failed. However, the weed is notorious for invading riverine ecosystems, spreading into other areas and causing negative socio-economic and ecological impacts. There is therefore an urgent need to develop innovative ideas to eradicate this invasive species, particularly the critical and fragile ecosystems within the ASALs in Kenya, specifically the shore lines of Lake Turkana, Lake Turkana National Parks, and Nasalot National Reserve.<br/><br/> Traditionally these fragile ecosystems used to be a major source of livelihoods for the local community as they provided grazing grounds during dry seasons. The introduction of Prosopis Juliflora (which is also toxic to animals) compounded by the effects associated with climate change such as the prolonged dry spells, has significantly reduced the ability of the local communities’ to cope and adapt to such changes. As a result, the concerned communities are experiencing chronic food shortages, loss of livelihoods and lives (both human and animals). There is therefore a critical need why the problems of the invasive Prosopis Juliflora plant needs to be addressed urgently. The high rate of colonization of farming fields, grazing lands and to some extent protected areas by Prosopis Juliflora, a serious threat to the integrity of these ecosystems, is further proof of the need to eradicate the plant. <br/><br/>The project will contribute to the achievement of area-based Aichi Targets of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 through management of the Prosopis Juliflora invasive species, an underlying cause of biodiversity loss in the ASALs and reducing the direct pressure it has on biodiversity in the area. The proposed project seeks to address the challenges posed by Prosopis Juliflora such as encroachment of habitable areas, irrigation schemes, crop farms and pasture lands significantly affecting biological diversity and rural livelihoods. The project is expected to eradicate Prosopis Juliflora by utilizing it to meet some community needs e.g. generation of cash from the sale of charcoal produced from the plant.<br/><br/><br/>The global concern of desertification caused the Government of Kenya in the 1980s to introduce Prosopis Juliflora in the Country. The plant is more aggressive in arid lands where it has formed thorny impenetrable thickets especially along water courses, rangelands, flood plains, roadsides and in habited areas. This encroachment upon paths, dwellings, irrigation schemes, crop farms and pastureland, significantly affect biological diversity and rural livelihoods. Prosopis invasion has reduced the capacity of pastoralists to keep large herds of livestock in affected areas and results also to un-cultivatable land, impacting severely on livelihoods and causing unsustainable use of alternative natural resources in the area. Prosopis Juliflora has invaded, and continues to invade thousand of hectares of rangelands in many parts of Kenya. It is particularly prevalent in Baringo, Garissa , Turkana and Tana River counties and parts of Eastern regions of the country. Around Lake Turkana, the entire shoreline from Kerio Delta to Todonyang has been covered preventing access to the delta for both farmers and pastoralists. Around Lodwar Town the plant has formed extensive thickets along River Turkwell, and is spreading across the floodplains of River Weiwei cutting off access to the river (Choge et al 2002). This invasive species has caused great damage by restricting grazing lands, taking over water ways and native vegetation. The impact among the affected pastoralist communities has in fact led to frequent lawsuits, pitting the community against the Kenyan Government. Invasion of Prosopis tends to form dense, impenetrable thickets, associated with unfavourable impacts on human economic activities. If this trend continues unchecked, the menace will go a long way in affecting communities’ and the country’s economic development. Action is even more urgently needed since the explosion is mainly affecting the semi-arid and arid lands of the country where local communities experience the highest poverty levels in the country. In Turkana County, poverty levels are at 67%. Prosopis will continue to aggressively invade pasture land and reduce grazing land, farmlands and opportunities for cultivation; in turn, this will reduce local community’s livelihood opportunity.

Prosopis Juliflora was introduced into Kenya’s Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs) through the efforts of Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and the Government of Kenya in response to over-grazing and over exploitation of its semi–arid woodlands. However, the invasive plant has turned out to be a liability to the local people by invading riverine ecosystems, spreading to even protected areas including Lake Turkana National Reserve causing negative socio-economic and ecological impacts. The proposed project is geared towards utilizing the invasive species by engaging local people through improved charcoal production technologies in most affected areas of Baringo,Turkana, Garissa and Tana River Counties thus enhancing their livelihoods and ecosystems restoration. In addition, this project is meant to restore large areas of grazing fields lost as a result of the invasion by Prosopis Juliflora. The plant has formed dense, impenetrable thickets which have inhibited the growth of other plant species and grass, thus resulting into insufficient grazing fields. Availability of grazing fields have all along been cushioning the pastoral communities during dry spells from the impacts of climate change, however, with the introduction of this invasive plant, pastoral communities have been exposed further to the impacts of climate change.",

The project also aims at introducing clean and efficient charcoal burning technologies to the local community. These technologies will increase the conversion rate of the fuel wood to charcoal thus saving on the number of trees that need to be felled to produce a certain charcoal threshold. Research has actually shown that improved charcoal production technologies are four times more efficient than the traditional charcoal producing technologies. These technologies, will also reduce the amount of black carbon emissions; black carbon is one of the most active climate forcers and thus its reduced emissions will serve to reduce the rate of climate forcers accumulation in the atmosphere."

There are documented cases of the harm caused by Prosopis Juliflora including the case of a woman in Baringo County who lost her eyesight as a result of being pricked by Prosopis thorn among other unfortunate cases. The input and spirit of this project is to reverse such incidences through clearing and harnessing this invasive plant."

				"comment": "It is worth noting that the Prosopis invasion is prevalent in Baringo and other arid and semi arid lands which are known to be home to biodiversity. Studies have actually shown that further expansion will not only affect people's livelihoods but also key sectors of the economy such as tourism. It is evident that Kenya's vast arid and semi-arid lands totaling 80% of land area are at risk and the longer the wait, the more difficult it will be to control or eradicate the species. The Prosopis menace has affected important wildlife habitats, parks, and water bodies which important tourist sites hence are drastically reducing the income earned from tourism. For example Lake Bogoria National Reserve and areas around Lake Baringo are greatly affected by Prosopis menace thereby reducing the number of tourists visiting these areas. This proposed project is aimed at restoring wildlife habitats and other fragile ecosystems that are susceptible to Prosopis invasion by providing alternative community livelihoods through harvesting and value addition on Prosopis products."

Poverty levels stood at about 44% according to the IMFi. This level has remained declined from 56% in 2002ii to the current levels. Efforts towards reduction of poverty include; land resetlemnts, rural development programs, and other initiatives undertaken by NGO’s, development partners and local communities. Management and control of invasive species specifically prosopis Juliflora is aimed at contributing towards Government efforts towards poverty reduction by providing alternative livelihoods while contemporaneously preserving the biodiversity of the regions. It aims at initiating pro-poor development growth strategies that emphasize on raising poor peoples’ ability to earn a living and ensure Environmental sustainability. With regard to National Climate Change strategiesiii, the Kenyan Ministry of Environment, Water and Natural Resources has recognized the need to enhance coordination of climate change activities in the country with a view to ensuring a climate proof- socio-economic development. This submission is relevant to Government strategy in that it aims at raising the awareness of the local people on how to harness invasive Prosopis Juliflora for livelihoods enhancement. Towards REDD+ strategies; The Government in partnership with NGOs and the private sector has embarked on massive restoration programs in ecologically fragile areas such as the Mau Ecosystem to benefit from carbon markets to supplement local resources. Similarly, Kenya Forest Service and other partners support community afforestation programs for example in Kakamega Forest as carbon offsets project.<br/><br/>In this vein, this proposed lifeweb submission is meant to restore fragile ecosytems which have been threatened by the invasive plant species by clearing the invasive plant to allow other plants to grow in this ecosyems thus acting as carbon offsets. Kenya’s Resource mobilization strategy recognizes co-funding as key to implementing her development programs. There is strong evidence of financial weakness among the implementing agencies hence this proposed project seeks for partnership on Resource Mobilization strategies to effectively create innovative ways and means of initiating livelihoods enhancing community projects and restore fragile ecosystems. Kenya’s Development strategy is anchored on the Kenya’s Vision 2030iv which aims at creating “a globally competitive and prosperous country with a high quality of life by 2030’’. By extension, the vision aspires to contextualize the MDGs for Kenya by 2015. To this effect,the Kenyan Government has put in place a wide range of policies, institutions and legislative frameworks to address the major causes of environmental degradations and negative impacts on ecosystems. Environmental Management and Coordination Act (EMCA 1999) was thus enacted to provide an appropriate legal institutional framework for the management of the Environment. In addition, Kenya is a member of the Convention on Biological Diversity(CBD) and has been implementing other International Development Treaties such as Agenda 21 and MDGs that are geared towards environmental protection and sustainable development.

					"summary": "The project seeks to harness Prosopis Juliflora for improved livelihoods and restoration of fragile ecosystems whose existence has been threatened by the plant through invasion of water ways, habitable, grazing and arable land leading to loss of both biodiversity and livelihood in Kenya’s ASALs.",
					"description": "The project seeks to harness Prosopis Juliflora for improved livelihoods and restoration of fragile ecosystems whose existence has been threatened by the plant through invasion of water ways, habitable, grazing and arable land leading to loss of both biodiversity and livelihood in Kenya’s ASALs. <br/><br/>Prosopis Juliflora is an invasive plant species which was introduced in Kenya to rehabilitate degraded dry-lands. Prosopis or ‘Mathenge’ as it is commonly known locally, is an evergreen, fast growing, nitrogen-fixing plant that is tolerant to arid conditions and saline soils. The plant is also known to survive where other tree species have failed. However, the weed is notorious for invading riverine ecosystems, spreading into other areas and causing negative socio-economic and ecological impacts. There is therefore an urgent need to develop innovative ideas to eradicate this invasive species, particularly the critical and fragile ecosystems within the ASALs in Kenya, specifically the shore lines of Lake Turkana, Lake Turkana National Parks, and Nasalot National Reserve.<br/><br/> Traditionally these fragile ecosystems used to be a major source of livelihoods for the local community as they provided grazing grounds during dry seasons. The introduction of Prosopis Juliflora (which is also toxic to animals) compounded by the effects associated with climate change such as the prolonged dry spells, has significantly reduced the ability of the local communities’ to cope and adapt to such changes. As a result, the concerned communities are experiencing chronic food shortages, loss of livelihoods and lives (both human and animals). There is therefore a critical need why the problems of the invasive Prosopis Juliflora plant needs to be addressed urgently. The high rate of colonization of farming fields, grazing lands and to some extent protected areas by Prosopis Juliflora, a serious threat to the integrity of these ecosystems, is further proof of the need to eradicate the plant. <br/><br/>The project will contribute to the achievement of area-based Aichi Targets of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 through management of the Prosopis Juliflora invasive species, an underlying cause of biodiversity loss in the ASALs and reducing the direct pressure it has on biodiversity in the area. The proposed project seeks to address the challenges posed by Prosopis Juliflora such as encroachment of habitable areas, irrigation schemes, crop farms and pasture lands significantly affecting biological diversity and rural livelihoods. The project is expected to eradicate Prosopis Juliflora by utilizing it to meet some community needs e.g. generation of cash from the sale of charcoal produced from the plant.<br/><br/><br/>The global concern of desertification caused the Government of Kenya in the 1980s to introduce Prosopis Juliflora in the Country. The plant is more aggressive in arid lands where it has formed thorny impenetrable thickets especially along water courses, rangelands, flood plains, roadsides and in habited areas. This encroachment upon paths, dwellings, irrigation schemes, crop farms and pastureland, significantly affect biological diversity and rural livelihoods. Prosopis invasion has reduced the capacity of pastoralists to keep large herds of livestock in affected areas and results also to un-cultivatable land, impacting severely on livelihoods and causing unsustainable use of alternative natural resources in the area. Prosopis Juliflora has invaded, and continues to invade thousand of hectares of rangelands in many parts of Kenya. It is particularly prevalent in Baringo, Garissa , Turkana and Tana River counties and parts of Eastern regions of the country. Around Lake Turkana, the entire shoreline from Kerio Delta to Todonyang has been covered preventing access to the delta for both farmers and pastoralists. Around Lodwar Town the plant has formed extensive thickets along River Turkwell, and is spreading across the floodplains of River Weiwei cutting off access to the river (Choge et al 2002). This invasive species has caused great damage by restricting grazing lands, taking over water ways and native vegetation. The impact among the affected pastoralist communities has in fact led to frequent lawsuits, pitting the community against the Kenyan Government. Invasion of Prosopis tends to form dense, impenetrable thickets, associated with unfavourable impacts on human economic activities. If this trend continues unchecked, the menace will go a long way in affecting communities’ and the country’s economic development. Action is even more urgently needed since the explosion is mainly affecting the semi-arid and arid lands of the country where local communities experience the highest poverty levels in the country. In Turkana County, poverty levels are at 67%. Prosopis will continue to aggressively invade pasture land and reduce grazing land, farmlands and opportunities for cultivation; in turn, this will reduce local community’s livelihood opportunity.

		"summary": "This project will support government implementation of marine biodiversity conservation actions at the regional, national and local levels and scale-up the coverage and effectiveness of marine conservation areas and threatened species protection in South East and East Asia in support of implementation of Sustainable Development Strategy for the Seas of East Asia (SDS-SEA).",
		"description": "The importance of effectively managed coastal and marine areas to food and energy security, biodiversity conservation, community health, climate change resilience, sustainable livelihoods and economic growth, is increasingly acknowledged. This is especially true of the South East and East Asia region, which hosts an immensely rich marine environment, including 30% of the world’s coral reefs, 35% of mangroves, about 18% of seagrass meadows. These ecosystems support the highest coastal marine biodiversity in the world along 234,000 kilometres of coastline, and provide the resource base and natural infrastructure which sustains a life support system for at least two billion people. <br/><br/>However, the ASEAN Biodiversity Outlook (ABO) confirms that the region failed to meet the target of significantly reducing biodiversity loss by 2010. Natural wealth continues to degrade at a relatively high rate, with loss of 26.46% of mangroves in Southeast Asia and 33.40% in East Asia from 1980 to 2005, or an annual change rate of 1.06% and 1.34% respectively (FAO, 2007). Coral reefs and seagrasses are also experiencing increased threats through habitat change, sea level rise and other impacts of climate change, over-exploitation and pollution. The Protected Areas Gap Analysis in ASEAN region (ACB, 2010), reports severe under-representation of marine habitats and ecosystems and absence of protection of 78%, or more than 6 million hectares, of the 82 identified marine Key Biodiversity Areas (mKBAs). For those protected mKBAs, management concerns remain an issue. Despite the increase in the proportion of MPA areas within the territorial waters of some countries, there have been notable declines in the quality and quantity of mangrove, seagrass and coral reef habitats within these MPAs. As a consequence, the population, health and resiliency of many threatened species, such as the Chinese White Dolphin, remain a matter of concern. <br/><br/>Although some coastal areas with sustained integrated management efforts have shown signs of environmental improvements, many threats to protecting and sustaining coastal and marine ecosystem services persist across the region, including: <br/>a. Land use transformation in coastal and upland areas <br/>b. Land reclamation in coastal and wetland areas <br/>c. Deforestation, erosion and sedimentation <br/>d. Degradation, destruction and over-exploitation of natural resources, including fisheries <br/>e. Continued trade in wildlife and endangered species <br/>f. Increasing populations and economic activities in coastal areas <br/>g. Conflicting uses and demands among users for limited coastal and marine resources, such as tourism, port development/marine transportation and fisheries <br/>h. Inequitable access to resources, resulting in food security and sustainable livelihood concerns, especially among fishing communities <br/>i. Marine pollution from land-based and sea-based sources <br/>j. Climate variation and change including extreme weather events.<br/><br/>The root causes for these continuing threats can be traced to one or more of the following: <br/>a. Lack of national policies on coasts and oceans and outdated national policies that conflict with the objectives of biodiversity conservation and sustainable development of coastal and marine resources <br/>b. Inadequate institutional mechanisms to facilitate coordination across communities, sectors, local and national governments, and their respective agencies and boundaries <br/>c. Inadequate legislation and the capacity to enforce regulations <br/>d. Insufficient mechanisms and incentives to engage local governments and the business sector in conservation investments <br/>e. Limited access to training and capacity building opportunities to build up human and financial capital to effectively manage protected areas <br/>f. Inadequate resources and capacity for scientifically sound environmental monitoring and reporting, coupled with lack of coordination of environmental monitoring efforts across agencies, programs and projects <br/>g. Inadequate funding for applied research on social and economic values of coastal and marine ecosystems and their contributions to sustainable development and security <br/>h. Limited knowledge or awareness of the value of coastal ecosystems services and the consequences of their degradation or loss <br/>i. Limited knowledge sharing on best practices and case studies within countries and across the region <br/>j. Limited buy-in by local governments and local stakeholders on the benefits of MPAs. In the face of complex threats to the globally important marine and coastal biodiversity in the East and Southeast Asia region, this project seeks to add value by applying a systematic approach to strengthening the management effectiveness of MPAs under a variety of political, social, economic and environmental conditions to implement the SDS-SEA.<br/><br/> The project will demonstrate the use of a conservation-focused integrated coastal management (ICM) framework and process to support and strengthen actions identified in national biodiversity strategies and action plans (NBSAPs). On-the-ground conservation actions will not only factor in the capacities and priorities of local communities, but also take into account critical issues such as climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction, food security, alternative livelihoods and pollution reduction, and incorporate these into the development plans of local governments. A stepwise and iterative approach will be adopted to facilitate systematic and integrated policy making, planning and management decision-taking.",

It is instrumental in establishing sustainable financing mechanisms which support conservation of resources and required environmental infrastructure improvements through public- and market-based sources, such as appropriation of annual budget allocations; user fees, tariffs, taxes, penalties and fines; and adoption of a corporate management approach to utilities and resource management. Applied ICM is used to reduce threats to biodiversity conservation, including those which impact on the regular supply of public goods and services generated through ecosystems, and are essential to coastal populations. It allows local governments and stakeholders to identify and define threats to sustainable coastal development, and put in place the appropriate management regimes to address these threats. These would include, but not be limited to a) natural and human-made disaster prevention and response management, b) natural coastal habitat protection, restoration and management, c) water use and supply management, pollution and waste reduction management, e) food security and livelihood management.<br/><br/> The project will build capacity of local governments and stakeholders to assess and mitigate/adapt to impacts of climate change. Given the prevalence of extreme weather events and international and national response mechanisms that have been formulated, there would be support for a suite of activities which range from data gathering on geohazards etc, establishment of early warning systems, risk and vulnerability assessments and formulation of disaster risk reduction and management strategies. There will also be an opportunity to collaborate with, and complement, other projects funded by bilateral and multilateral donor agencies (list of donor initiatives including GIZ in EAS region attached in Appendix 4 of Project Narrative Document)."

				"comment": "There is some consensus in the scientific community, that the management of coastal “blue carbon” ecosystems, through conservation initiatives which avoid loss and degradation, restore and promote sustainable use, can serve as a “transformational tool” in effective management of natural carbon. There is today, a better scientific understanding of emissions from coastal ecosystems, and how carbon is sequestered, which will help to develop carbon management policies and related incentives, including financial incentives to support mitigation and adaptation through coastal blue carbon initiatives.<br/><br/>“Blue carbon sinks” can account for between 50% and 71% of all carbon storage in ocean sediments. They comprise only 0.05% of the plant biomass on land, but store a comparable amount of carbon per year, and thus rank among the most intense carbon sinks on the planet. While the estimated burial rates of these ecosystems are subject to continual scientific inquiry, there is evidence to suggest that this is more significant than the forest carbon equation.<br/><br/>To illustrate, a study conducted under the auspices of the IUCN, CI and Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), confirmed that seagrass meadows can store up to two times the amount of carbon as temperate and tropical forests. Seagrass beds are able to store up to 83,000 metric tons (MT) of carbon per square kilometre (mostly in the roots and soil), compared to terrestrial forest stores of about 30,000 MT per km2. There are estimates that seagrass meadows constitute only 0.2 per cent of the oceans, but are responsible for over 10% of carbon buried at sea on an annual basis. This is in contrast to the fact that almost 30% of the world’s seagrasses have been destroyed, with annual loss rates of 1.5% per annum. Destruction of seagrasses through dredging and water quality degradation contributes significantly to carbon emissions. Seagrasses provide important ecosystem services, and if properly restored, seagrass meadows can sequester carbon at a relatively fast rate.<br/><br/>The project will focus technical assistance to build national and local scientific and technical capacity to engage in this aspect of the carbon equation. More information on the approach is presented in the Project Narrative Document."

The fishing sector itself requires management and, in particular, the implementation of various codes of conduct. Activities in sustainable coastal and marine areas affect fisheries, and therefore a sustainable supply of fisheries can also be an outcome of good management of these other issues. It is also important to ensure the accessibility of the poor to fisheries resources, given its role as a major traditional source of animal protein for the coastal poor. Supplemental livelihood programs for coastal communities can also be set in place to reduce stresses on the fishery and to increase income and well-being from other forms of livelihood. Biodiversity conservation and sustainable use through MPA development and management addresses these concerns directly. Documentation on the outputs of strengthened MPA management suggests that: a) fish abundance and catch can increase significantly and b) fish size, biomass and reproductive potential can be enhanced. If MPA networks are appropriately designed, there can also be export of eggs, larvae and adults to other areas."

Sustainable management programs include an understanding of the sources and characteristics of contaminants and waste materials entering the environment, what is required to change behaviors to reduce/ eliminate pollution, policy reforms, legislation, capacity development, market-based procurement and management instruments, awareness building, incentives and enforcement mechanisms to address these threats. Greater fish catches lead to higher protein intake in regular diets, and a perceived (and measurable) improvement in children’s health in particular. More incomes permit increased investments in health-related and preventive care expenditures at the household level. Local government investments other components of ecosystem management, such as solid waste, septage treatment and waste water management, will reduce effluent flowing into the MPA. There would be increase in awareness of the importance of good sanitation practices."

This will require collaboration with the local tourism authorities, and formulation of a destination development plan, which builds on or complements existing land-use, fisheries, coastal zone or other overarching management plans. Linked to this would be opportunities for alternative livelihoods, which would include aquaculture, seaweed farming, small scale fisheries and related value chain activities. In some cases, fishers who switch to new occupations in the tourist industry earn considerably higher incomes. Alternative livelihoods can also be created, but may be susceptible to market forces (e.g., commodity prices for seaweed). Larger, capital-intensive investments in tourism are more likely to lead to long-term gains in non-fishing income. In some cases, there could be diversified job creation, and widening of opportunities for women."

					"description": "The importance of effectively managed coastal and marine areas to food and energy security, biodiversity conservation, community health, climate change resilience, sustainable livelihoods and economic growth, is increasingly acknowledged. This is especially true of the South East and East Asia region, which hosts an immensely rich marine environment, including 30% of the world’s coral reefs, 35% of mangroves, about 18% of seagrass meadows. These ecosystems support the highest coastal marine biodiversity in the world along 234,000 kilometres of coastline, and provide the resource base and natural infrastructure which sustains a life support system for at least two billion people. <br/><br/>However, the ASEAN Biodiversity Outlook (ABO) confirms that the region failed to meet the target of significantly reducing biodiversity loss by 2010. Natural wealth continues to degrade at a relatively high rate, with loss of 26.46% of mangroves in Southeast Asia and 33.40% in East Asia from 1980 to 2005, or an annual change rate of 1.06% and 1.34% respectively (FAO, 2007). Coral reefs and seagrasses are also experiencing increased threats through habitat change, sea level rise and other impacts of climate change, over-exploitation and pollution. The Protected Areas Gap Analysis in ASEAN region (ACB, 2010), reports severe under-representation of marine habitats and ecosystems and absence of protection of 78%, or more than 6 million hectares, of the 82 identified marine Key Biodiversity Areas (mKBAs). For those protected mKBAs, management concerns remain an issue. Despite the increase in the proportion of MPA areas within the territorial waters of some countries, there have been notable declines in the quality and quantity of mangrove, seagrass and coral reef habitats within these MPAs. As a consequence, the population, health and resiliency of many threatened species, such as the Chinese White Dolphin, remain a matter of concern. <br/><br/>Although some coastal areas with sustained integrated management efforts have shown signs of environmental improvements, many threats to protecting and sustaining coastal and marine ecosystem services persist across the region, including: <br/>a. Land use transformation in coastal and upland areas <br/>b. Land reclamation in coastal and wetland areas <br/>c. Deforestation, erosion and sedimentation <br/>d. Degradation, destruction and over-exploitation of natural resources, including fisheries <br/>e. Continued trade in wildlife and endangered species <br/>f. Increasing populations and economic activities in coastal areas <br/>g. Conflicting uses and demands among users for limited coastal and marine resources, such as tourism, port development/marine transportation and fisheries <br/>h. Inequitable access to resources, resulting in food security and sustainable livelihood concerns, especially among fishing communities <br/>i. Marine pollution from land-based and sea-based sources <br/>j. Climate variation and change including extreme weather events.<br/><br/>The root causes for these continuing threats can be traced to one or more of the following: <br/>a. Lack of national policies on coasts and oceans and outdated national policies that conflict with the objectives of biodiversity conservation and sustainable development of coastal and marine resources <br/>b. Inadequate institutional mechanisms to facilitate coordination across communities, sectors, local and national governments, and their respective agencies and boundaries <br/>c. Inadequate legislation and the capacity to enforce regulations <br/>d. Insufficient mechanisms and incentives to engage local governments and the business sector in conservation investments <br/>e. Limited access to training and capacity building opportunities to build up human and financial capital to effectively manage protected areas <br/>f. Inadequate resources and capacity for scientifically sound environmental monitoring and reporting, coupled with lack of coordination of environmental monitoring efforts across agencies, programs and projects <br/>g. Inadequate funding for applied research on social and economic values of coastal and marine ecosystems and their contributions to sustainable development and security <br/>h. Limited knowledge or awareness of the value of coastal ecosystems services and the consequences of their degradation or loss <br/>i. Limited knowledge sharing on best practices and case studies within countries and across the region <br/>j. Limited buy-in by local governments and local stakeholders on the benefits of MPAs. In the face of complex threats to the globally important marine and coastal biodiversity in the East and Southeast Asia region, this project seeks to add value by applying a systematic approach to strengthening the management effectiveness of MPAs under a variety of political, social, economic and environmental conditions to implement the SDS-SEA.<br/><br/> The project will demonstrate the use of a conservation-focused integrated coastal management (ICM) framework and process to support and strengthen actions identified in national biodiversity strategies and action plans (NBSAPs). On-the-ground conservation actions will not only factor in the capacities and priorities of local communities, but also take into account critical issues such as climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction, food security, alternative livelihoods and pollution reduction, and incorporate these into the development plans of local governments. A stepwise and iterative approach will be adopted to facilitate systematic and integrated policy making, planning and management decision-taking.",

					"description": "The importance of effectively managed coastal and marine areas to food and energy security, biodiversity conservation, community health, climate change resilience, sustainable livelihoods and economic growth, is increasingly acknowledged. This is especially true of the South East and East Asia region, which hosts an immensely rich marine environment, including 30% of the world’s coral reefs, 35% of mangroves, about 18% of seagrass meadows. These ecosystems support the highest coastal marine biodiversity in the world along 234,000 kilometres of coastline, and provide the resource base and natural infrastructure which sustains a life support system for at least two billion people. <br/><br/>However, the ASEAN Biodiversity Outlook (ABO) confirms that the region failed to meet the target of significantly reducing biodiversity loss by 2010. Natural wealth continues to degrade at a relatively high rate, with loss of 26.46% of mangroves in Southeast Asia and 33.40% in East Asia from 1980 to 2005, or an annual change rate of 1.06% and 1.34% respectively (FAO, 2007). Coral reefs and seagrasses are also experiencing increased threats through habitat change, sea level rise and other impacts of climate change, over-exploitation and pollution. The Protected Areas Gap Analysis in ASEAN region (ACB, 2010), reports severe under-representation of marine habitats and ecosystems and absence of protection of 78%, or more than 6 million hectares, of the 82 identified marine Key Biodiversity Areas (mKBAs). For those protected mKBAs, management concerns remain an issue.

		"summary": "The Ministry of Environment in Lebanon and the IUCN are implementing since 2010 a project on “Supporting the management of important marine habitats and species in Lebanon”, which aims ultimately to create a network of MPAs in Lebanon and have produced in 2012 the “Lebanon Marine Protected Areas Strategy” which has identified 18 candidate MPAs in the country responding to the MPAs criteria. PAs in Lebanon cover about 4.2% of the country surface area, the existing MPAs cover 0.08% of the Lebanon, hence, there is a need to increase the areas of MPAs in Lebanon in order to conserve all types of available ecosystems and a wider variety of fauna and flora, mainly the threatened species, and to meet the target 11 of Aichi. Accordingly, the current proposal intends to support the implementation of some activities of the MoE/IUCN strategy and to support the establishment of the proposed MPAs that were identified in the national strategy and thus facilitating the creation of the MPAs network in Lebanon and to strengthen the network itself, through improvement of institutional structure and management of resources within the organizations and the local communities of each of the existing and candidate MPAs.",

PINR comprises three flat sandy-rocky islands with a total area of 4.2 km2, at 5.5 km offshore Tripoli/Lebanon. The Tyre Coast Reserve lies at c.1-15 m of altitude, in the vicinity of Tyre city and the Palestinian Rachidieh camp. It covers an area of c.3.8 km². The PINR is of important natural heritage value due to the fact that it constitutes the only islands of significance in the country. Its ecological functions are numerous: It attracts nesting, migrating and wintering bird populations of global concern like Corncrake, White-tail Eagle, Egyptian Vulture, Auddouin’s Gull, and more than 156 species of birds (40% of the national avifauna on 0.04% of the Lebanon’s surface area; constitutes one of the apparently last refuges in Lebanon for the globally threatened Monk Seal. The flora recall the disappeared flora of the littoral area on the mailand. The flora, invertebrtes, herpetofauna, 4 etc. show a certain level of endemism to the region and certain particularities of biogeographical interest. Being one of the most beautiful and scenic sandy beaches in Lebanon, TCNR is a mixture of marine and terrestrial ecosystems made from agriculture lands, coastal sand dunes, wide sandy beaches, freshwater marshes and springs. These springs feed 1500 l / sec into three striking pools of Ras Al Ain. The pools provide a freshwater habitat and the off-flow creates small areas of marshland attractive to amphibian and water birds such as ducks, crakes, coots, snipes, etc. The inflow of fresh water from the springs into the sea creates productive brackish water that is rich in aquatic species. The reserve’s beach has special significance as a nesting site for the globally endangered marine turtles (Green and Loggerhead). <br/><br/>Both reserves are vital for their ecological services in the littoral and near littoral areas that are located in areas under high anthropologic pressure. Being located within the biodiversity hotspot area, the two reserves are important for the conservation of biodiversity at both regional and global levels. Their wildrelatives and landraces are of significant genetic varieties. The species of these two MPAs are protected only during their presence in the reserves but they are threatened when they are outside the limits of the reserves.<br/><br/>Subsequently, our proposed project will support the creation of an effective marine protected areas network by supporting the establishment of the marine areas proposed by the Strategy as “candidates MPAs” and which are necessary for the ecological niche or the function of many marine species, and the project also will contribute in the sustainable development by enhancing institutional capacity and resource management.<br/><br/>The project will help as such in increasing the surface area of MPAs in the Eastern Mediterranean, a matter that is in line with the Aichi Target 11 and Lebanon NBSAP that will be updated in this direction in the year 2014. Among the candidate MPAs identified in the Strategy the following sites were already assessed through field survey : Batroun site, Jbeil site and the Medfoun site were assessed by the MoE/ IUCN project, in addition, Ras El Chekaa Cliff, Raoucheh rocks, Enfeh, Nakoura, Sidon rocks, Tyre islands were also assessed by RAC/SPA through the MedMPAnet project with technical collaboration of IUCN. . The proposed project intends to strengthen the management of PINR, TCNR and the above mentioned candidates MPAs which are important for the livelihoods of local households and stakeholders at various levels. All these sites constitute a source of incomes for the local communities. Furthermore, the proposed project would like to progressively incorporate additional sites in its Network after examining their appropriateness and location from property and/or security points of view, and the degree of preparedness of the local communities in the management of those sites. This project proposal thus will assist the Ministry of Environment in preparing the necessary files for the declaration of the aspiring sites as MPAs.",

Its ecological functions are numerous: It attracts nesting, migrating and wintering bird populations of global concern like Corncrake, White-tail Eagle, Egyptian Vulture, Auddouin’s Gull, and more than 156 species of birds (40% of the national avifauna on 0.04% of the Lebanon’s surface area; constitutes one of the apparently last refuges in Lebanon for the globally threatened Monk Seal. The flora recall the disappeared flora of the littoral area on the mailand. The flora, invertebrtes, herpetofauna, 4 etc. show a certain level of endemism to the region and certain particularities of biogeographical interest. Being one of the most beautiful and scenic sandy beaches in Lebanon, TCNR is a mixture of marine and terrestrial ecosystems made from agriculture lands, coastal sand dunes, wide sandy beaches, freshwater marshes and springs. These springs feed 1500 l / sec into three striking pools of Ras Al Ain. The pools provide a freshwater habitat and the off-flow creates small areas of marshland attractive to amphibian and water birds such as ducks, crakes, coots, snipes, etc. The inflow of fresh water from the springs into the sea creates productive brackish water that is rich in aquatic species. The reserve’s beach has special significance as a nesting site for the globally endangered marine turtles (Green and Loggerhead). <br/><br/>Both reserves are vital for their ecological services in the littoral and near littoral areas that are located in areas under high anthropologic pressure. Being located within the biodiversity hotspot area, the two reserves are important for the conservation of biodiversity at both regional and global levels. Their wildrelatives and landraces are of significant genetic varieties. The species of these two MPAs are protected only during their presence in the reserves but they are threatened when they are outside the limits of the reserves.<br/><br/>Subsequently, our proposed project will support the creation of an effective marine protected areas network by supporting the establishment of the marine areas proposed by the Strategy as “candidates MPAs” and which are necessary for the ecological niche or the function of many marine species, and the project also will contribute in the sustainable development by enhancing institutional capacity and resource management.<br/><br/>The project will help as such in increasing the surface area of MPAs in the Eastern Mediterranean, a matter that is in line with the Aichi Target 11 and Lebanon NBSAP that will be updated in this direction in the year 2014. Among the candidate MPAs identified in the Strategy the following sites were already assessed through field survey : Batroun site, Jbeil site and the Medfoun site were assessed by the MoE/ IUCN project, in addition, Ras El Chekaa Cliff, Raoucheh rocks, Enfeh, Nakoura, Sidon rocks, Tyre islands were also assessed by RAC/SPA through the MedMPAnet project with technical collaboration of IUCN. . The proposed project intends to strengthen the management of PINR, TCNR and the above mentioned candidates MPAs which are important for the livelihoods of local households and stakeholders at various levels. All these sites constitute a source of incomes for the local communities. Furthermore, the proposed project would like to progressively incorporate additional sites in its Network after examining their appropriateness and location from property and/or security points of view, and the degree of preparedness of the local communities in the management of those sites. This project proposal thus will assist the Ministry of Environment in preparing the necessary files for the declaration of the aspiring sites as MPAs.",

					"summary": "The Ministry of Environment in Lebanon and the IUCN are implementing since 2010 a project on “Supporting the management of important marine habitats and species in Lebanon”, which aims ultimately to create a network of MPAs in Lebanon and have produced in 2012 the “Lebanon Marine Protected Areas Strategy” which has identified 18 candidate MPAs in the country responding to the MPAs criteria. PAs in Lebanon cover about 4.2% of the country surface area, the existing MPAs cover 0.08% of the Lebanon, hence, there is a need to increase the areas of MPAs in Lebanon in order to conserve all types of available ecosystems and a wider variety of fauna and flora, mainly the threatened species, and to meet the target 11 of Aichi. Accordingly, the current proposal intends to support the implementation of some activities of the MoE/IUCN strategy and to support the establishment of the proposed MPAs that were identified in the national strategy and thus facilitating the creation of the MPAs network in Lebanon and to strengthen the network itself, through improvement of institutional structure and management of resources within the organizations and the local communities of each of the existing and candidate MPAs.",
					"description": "Palm Islands Nature Reserve (PINR) and Tyre Coat Nature Reserve (TCNR) are among the most important marine protected areas on the eastern corner of the Mediterranean basin.

		"summary": "The Gambia is endowed with rich natural resources, if properly managed, can make a considerable contribution to the global biodiversity targets. In order for Gambia to meet its requirements under the Convention of Biological Diversity and other related multi lateral environmental agreements, the following components of marine and coastal biodiversity and their management must be strengthened considerably.<br/><br/> However, the project seeks to address among others the climate induce problems such as coastal erosion, flooding, salinization, mangrove dieback etc. It will enhance poverty reduction for adjacent communities through sustainable land management and to address capacity needs. This will be achieved through enforcement of management strategies and awareness raising.<br/><br/>The project is expected to ensure effective and sustainable use of the Gambia’s marine and coastal resources and to contribute to address climate issues and enhanced improved community livelihood.",
		"description": "The Gambia contains globally significant biodiversity.  Although small in size, The Gambia harbors a wealth of terrestrial, coastal, marine and wetland habitats and species of local, national, regional and global significance.  The coastal and marine environment is defined in the Gambian context as not only those areas that border the Atlantic but also those with brackish water that border the River Gambia, extending 200km inland.  It is one of the areas identified as of particular importance in the GEAP and NBSAP. It is a natural resource rich area with particularly high biodiversity of national, regional and global environmental significance.  <br/><br/> Currently 4.9 per cent of Gambian national territory is legally protected, with the goal being set to increase this area to 10 per cent by 2020. The current formal protected area system comprises 7 national parks and nature reserves, under the mandate of the Department of Parks and Wildlife (DPWM), and is complemented by a community managed reserve, Bolong Fenyo, and as well as a series of forest reserves managed by the Department of Forestry together with local communities.  The protected area network is representative of the principal habitats and  ecosystems found in the country, and houses several habitats and rare and endangered species of global importance.  Habitat types within the protected area network include mangrove ecosystems, tidal zones, as well as guinea savannah and dry deciduous woodlands.  Mangrove and tidal areas serve as important spawning and nursery grounds for more than 114 species of coastal and marine fish, providing nesting and feeding habitats for endangered and threatened species such as migratory birds (East Atlantic Flyway), Audouin’s Gull (globally endangered), dolphins (including the Atlantic Humpback dolphin which is endemic to the Atlantic Ocean’s African coast), sharks, marine turtles (leatherback, loggerhead and green), the West African manatee, West African dwarf crocodile, West African red Colobus, clawless otter, hippopotamus, and others. In addition, more than 576 species of birds are identified in the Gambia among which 10% are migratory. Three of the Gambia’s protected areas are recognized as Wetlands of International importance under the RAMSAR convention: Tanbi Wetlands National Park, Niumi National Park and Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve. Six are recognised by the Birdlife International Partnership as Important Bird Areas:  Tanji, Tanbi, Abuko, Niumi, Bao Bolong and Kiang West , of which both Tanji and Niumi regularly surpass the 1 percent criteria for Royal terns, Caspian terns, and others. <br/><br/>The Gambia’s coastal and marine areas are under increasing pressure. A large proportion of the country’s population resides in coastal areas and depends upon them for their livelihoods.  Population growth and in-migration as a result of disrupted rainfall patterns and land degradation in the hinterland translates into growing pressure on coastal and marine resources.  Anthropogenic pressures arising from subsistence and small-scale economic exploitation include sand mining, fishing, clearing of forest and mangroves for fish-smoking, use as domestic fuel, arable crop production, and pastoralism.  There is also evidence of significant pressure on species of global and regional concern such as nesting and migratory birds and marine turtles, the eggs of which are frequently collected; sharks, harvested for their fins; and manatees, hunted for meat, as well as growing conflicts between the population and species such as hippopotamus as the two are increasingly forced to depend upon the same resources for survival.  The coast also is the primary tourism attraction of The Gambia, which alongside other economic development initiatives is increasing development pressure in this zone. <br/><br/>The project will initiate ABS strategies that will improve livelihoods of adjacent communities for enhancement of their participation towards conservation and sustainable use of coastal and marine biodiversity; it will include mainstreaming of gender issues. However, these strategies will gear towards addressing the objective of the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and their fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization.  <br/><br/>There is strong national commitment to protecting the country’s natural resources. DPWM is the government agency responsible for ensuring the management of the country’s protected area network as well as for the conservation of its biodiversity both within and outside this network.  While, DPWM is expected to take the lead in ensuring application of existing policies and legislation and to promote initiatives on the ground leading to sustainable management and use of biodiversity resources, it is recognised that it cannot do this alone.  DPWM hence works in close collaboration with other government agencies, NGOs and civil society partners.  Unfortunately, DPWM’s capacity to capitalize on the opportunities provided by this broader framework and to leverage resources (both human and financial) for the promotion of biodiversity development is severely constrained by the Department’s internal structural and functional challenges, weak staff capacity and implementation experience as well as by limited scientific and technical knowledge and insufficient funding. <br/><br/>Because of this globally significant biodiversity the GEF invested US$ 1 million to support the Integrated Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Management (ICAM) Project.  This project, which closed in March 2008, strengthened the coastal and marine protected area system and in-situ conservation of globally significant species and habitats. Through the project, coverage of the protected area system was expanded by 23%, including the legal designation of the Tanbi Wetland Complex as a National Park and the designation of the country’s first Community Wildlife Reserve at Bolong Fenyo.  In addition, the project developed and piloted innovative participatory approaches to conservation that have fostered ownership and commitment to the protected areas amongst local stakeholders.  These included the establishment of Site Management Committees as a counterpart to DPWM, and the provision of  grants for community sub-projects for bio-diversity friendly alternative livelihood activities. Two participatory management plans, one for each area, were prepared and validated by stakeholders and a participatory process for identification of community co-management and alternative livelihood projects was developed and tested.  Baseline studies were conducted and conservation action plans prepared for three endangered and threatened species:  marine turtles, manatees and dolphins, and related species monitoring databases were developed.  An institutional analysis was completed for DPWM, identifying human resource and organisational weaknesses and laying out a restructuring plan aimed at equipping DPWM with the human and institutional resources for implementing its mandate over the long term.  Lastly, the project contributed substantively to the development of stronger linkages with regional partners and networks.<br/><br/> While the ICAM project successfully put in place some of the building blocks for future conservation and management of coastal and marine protected areas in The Gambia, there remains a need for further consolidation of these gains.  The recommendations from the Institutional Analysis have yet to be implemented and, in the absence of this, DPWM’s ability to fulfil its mandate for biodiversity conservation and protected area management remains seriously constrained.  Government budgetary allocations are limited, potential revenue streams from the protected areas are untapped, and on-the-ground management is largely dependent upon a patchwork of donor-financed projects addressing specific parks, themes or species in accordance with the donors’ prevailing interests. Given this, in addition to improving the efficacy of departmental functioning and enhancing the skill base and incentive structures for its staff, there is also an urgent need to develop a strategic framework and business plan which determine concretely how the biodiversity and protected area management goals laid out in the broader vision documents such as the PRSP, GEAP, NBSAP and NASA are actually to be met by DPWM (and its partners) over the short, medium and long term.  <br/><br/> There are also challenges to be met on the ground.  Despite the significant gains made under ICAM, particularly regarding the legal status and participatory management framework for Tanbi and Bolong Fenyo, and management and monitoring of specific species, there is still a need to consolidate and build upon these initiatives and to expand the management effectiveness and participatory approaches developed under ICAM in order to meet the biodiversity conservation challenges in other protected areas.",

					"description": "The Gambia contains globally significant biodiversity.  Although small in size, The Gambia harbors a wealth of terrestrial, coastal, marine and wetland habitats and species of local, national, regional and global significance.  The coastal and marine environment is defined in the Gambian context as not only those areas that border the Atlantic but also those with brackish water that border the River Gambia, extending 200km inland.  It is one of the areas identified as of particular importance in the GEAP and NBSAP. It is a natural resource rich area with particularly high biodiversity of national, regional and global environmental significance.  <br/><br/> Currently 4.9 per cent of Gambian national territory is legally protected, with the goal being set to increase this area to 10 per cent by 2020. The current formal protected area system comprises 7 national parks and nature reserves, under the mandate of the Department of Parks and Wildlife (DPWM), and is complemented by a community managed reserve, Bolong Fenyo, and as well as a series of forest reserves managed by the Department of Forestry together with local communities.  The protected area network is representative of the principal habitats and  ecosystems found in the country, and houses several habitats and rare and endangered species of global importance.  Habitat types within the protected area network include mangrove ecosystems, tidal zones, as well as guinea savannah and dry deciduous woodlands.  Mangrove and tidal areas serve as important spawning and nursery grounds for more than 114 species of coastal and marine fish, providing nesting and feeding habitats for endangered and threatened species such as migratory birds (East Atlantic Flyway), Audouin’s Gull (globally endangered), dolphins (including the Atlantic Humpback dolphin which is endemic to the Atlantic Ocean’s African coast), sharks, marine turtles (leatherback, loggerhead and green), the West African manatee, West African dwarf crocodile, West African red Colobus, clawless otter, hippopotamus, and others. In addition, more than 576 species of birds are identified in the Gambia among which 10% are migratory. Three of the Gambia’s protected areas are recognized as Wetlands of International importance under the RAMSAR convention: Tanbi Wetlands National Park, Niumi National Park and Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve. Six are recognised by the Birdlife International Partnership as Important Bird Areas:  Tanji, Tanbi, Abuko, Niumi, Bao Bolong and Kiang West , of which both Tanji and Niumi regularly surpass the 1 percent criteria for Royal terns, Caspian terns, and others. <br/><br/>The Gambia’s coastal and marine areas are under increasing pressure. A large proportion of the country’s population resides in coastal areas and depends upon them for their livelihoods.  Population growth and in-migration as a result of disrupted rainfall patterns and land degradation in the hinterland translates into growing pressure on coastal and marine resources.  Anthropogenic pressures arising from subsistence and small-scale economic exploitation include sand mining, fishing, clearing of forest and mangroves for fish-smoking, use as domestic fuel, arable crop production, and pastoralism.  There is also evidence of significant pressure on species of global and regional concern such as nesting and migratory birds and marine turtles, the eggs of which are frequently collected; sharks, harvested for their fins; and manatees, hunted for meat, as well as growing conflicts between the population and species such as hippopotamus as the two are increasingly forced to depend upon the same resources for survival.  The coast also is the primary tourism attraction of The Gambia, which alongside other economic development initiatives is increasing development pressure in this zone. <br/><br/>The project will initiate ABS strategies that will improve livelihoods of adjacent communities for enhancement of their participation towards conservation and sustainable use of coastal and marine biodiversity; it will include mainstreaming of gender issues. However, these strategies will gear towards addressing the objective of the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and their fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization.  <br/><br/>There is strong national commitment to protecting the country’s natural resources. DPWM is the government agency responsible for ensuring the management of the country’s protected area network as well as for the conservation of its biodiversity both within and outside this network.  While, DPWM is expected to take the lead in ensuring application of existing policies and legislation and to promote initiatives on the ground leading to sustainable management and use of biodiversity resources, it is recognised that it cannot do this alone.  DPWM hence works in close collaboration with other government agencies, NGOs and civil society partners.  Unfortunately, DPWM’s capacity to capitalize on the opportunities provided by this broader framework and to leverage resources (both human and financial) for the promotion of biodiversity development is severely constrained by the Department’s internal structural and functional challenges, weak staff capacity and implementation experience as well as by limited scientific and technical knowledge and insufficient funding. <br/><br/>Because of this globally significant biodiversity the GEF invested US$ 1 million to support the Integrated Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Management (ICAM) Project.  This project, which closed in March 2008, strengthened the coastal and marine protected area system and in-situ conservation of globally significant species and habitats. Through the project, coverage of the protected area system was expanded by 23%, including the legal designation of the Tanbi Wetland Complex as a National Park and the designation of the country’s first Community Wildlife Reserve at Bolong Fenyo.  In addition, the project developed and piloted innovative participatory approaches to conservation that have fostered ownership and commitment to the protected areas amongst local stakeholders.  These included the establishment of Site Management Committees as a counterpart to DPWM, and the provision of  grants for community sub-projects for bio-diversity friendly alternative livelihood activities. Two participatory management plans, one for each area, were prepared and validated by stakeholders and a participatory process for identification of community co-management and alternative livelihood projects was developed and tested.  Baseline studies were conducted and conservation action plans prepared for three endangered and threatened species:  marine turtles, manatees and dolphins, and related species monitoring databases were developed.  An institutional analysis was completed for DPWM, identifying human resource and organisational weaknesses and laying out a restructuring plan aimed at equipping DPWM with the human and institutional resources for implementing its mandate over the long term.  Lastly, the project contributed substantively to the development of stronger linkages with regional partners and networks.<br/><br/> While the ICAM project successfully put in place some of the building blocks for future conservation and management of coastal and marine protected areas in The Gambia, there remains a need for further consolidation of these gains.  The recommendations from the Institutional Analysis have yet to be implemented and, in the absence of this, DPWM’s ability to fulfil its mandate for biodiversity conservation and protected area management remains seriously constrained.  Government budgetary allocations are limited, potential revenue streams from the protected areas are untapped, and on-the-ground management is largely dependent upon a patchwork of donor-financed projects addressing specific parks, themes or species in accordance with the donors’ prevailing interests. Given this, in addition to improving the efficacy of departmental functioning and enhancing the skill base and incentive structures for its staff, there is also an urgent need to develop a strategic framework and business plan which determine concretely how the biodiversity and protected area management goals laid out in the broader vision documents such as the PRSP, GEAP, NBSAP and NASA are actually to be met by DPWM (and its partners) over the short, medium and long term.  <br/><br/> There are also challenges to be met on the ground.  Despite the significant gains made under ICAM, particularly regarding the legal status and participatory management framework for Tanbi and Bolong Fenyo, and management and monitoring of specific species, there is still a need to consolidate and build upon these initiatives and to expand the management effectiveness and participatory approaches developed under ICAM in order to meet the biodiversity conservation challenges in other protected areas.",

					"description": "The Gambia contains globally significant biodiversity.  Although small in size, The Gambia harbors a wealth of terrestrial, coastal, marine and wetland habitats and species of local, national, regional and global significance.  The coastal and marine environment is defined in the Gambian context as not only those areas that border the Atlantic but also those with brackish water that border the River Gambia, extending 200km inland.  It is one of the areas identified as of particular importance in the GEAP and NBSAP. It is a natural resource rich area with particularly high biodiversity of national, regional and global environmental significance.  <br/><br/> Currently 4.9 per cent of Gambian national territory is legally protected, with the goal being set to increase this area to 10 per cent by 2020. The current formal protected area system comprises 7 national parks and nature reserves, under the mandate of the Department of Parks and Wildlife (DPWM), and is complemented by a community managed reserve, Bolong Fenyo, and as well as a series of forest reserves managed by the Department of Forestry together with local communities.  The protected area network is representative of the principal habitats and  ecosystems found in the country, and houses several habitats and rare and endangered species of global importance.  Habitat types within the protected area network include mangrove ecosystems, tidal zones, as well as guinea savannah and dry deciduous woodlands.  Mangrove and tidal areas serve as important spawning and nursery grounds for more than 114 species of coastal and marine fish, providing nesting and feeding habitats for endangered and threatened species such as migratory birds (East Atlantic Flyway), Audouin’s Gull (globally endangered), dolphins (including the Atlantic Humpback dolphin which is endemic to the Atlantic Ocean’s African coast), sharks, marine turtles (leatherback, loggerhead and green), the West African manatee, West African dwarf crocodile, West African red Colobus, clawless otter, hippopotamus, and others. In addition, more than 576 species of birds are identified in the Gambia among which 10% are migratory. Three of the Gambia’s protected areas are recognized as Wetlands of International importance under the RAMSAR convention: Tanbi Wetlands National Park, Niumi National Park and Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve. Six are recognised by the Birdlife International Partnership as Important Bird Areas:  Tanji, Tanbi, Abuko, Niumi, Bao Bolong and Kiang West , of which both Tanji and Niumi regularly surpass the 1 percent criteria for Royal terns, Caspian terns, and others. <br/><br/>The Gambia’s coastal and marine areas are under increasing pressure. A large proportion of the country’s population resides in coastal areas and depends upon them for their livelihoods.  Population growth and in-migration as a result of disrupted rainfall patterns and land degradation in the hinterland translates into growing pressure on coastal and marine resources.  Anthropogenic pressures arising from subsistence and small-scale economic exploitation include sand mining, fishing, clearing of forest and mangroves for fish-smoking, use as domestic fuel, arable crop production, and pastoralism.  There is also evidence of significant pressure on species of global and regional concern such as nesting and migratory birds and marine turtles, the eggs of which are frequently collected; sharks, harvested for their fins; and manatees, hunted for meat, as well as growing conflicts between the population and species such as hippopotamus as the two are increasingly forced to depend upon the same resources for survival.  The coast also is the primary tourism attraction of The Gambia, which alongside other economic development initiatives is increasing development pressure in this zone. <br/><br/>The project will initiate ABS strategies that will improve livelihoods of adjacent communities for enhancement of their participation towards conservation and sustainable use of coastal and marine biodiversity; it will include mainstreaming of gender issues. However, these strategies will gear towards addressing the objective of the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and their fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization.  <br/><br/>There is strong national commitment to protecting the country’s natural resources. DPWM is the government agency responsible for ensuring the management of the country’s protected area network as well as for the conservation of its biodiversity both within and outside this network.  While, DPWM is expected to take the lead in ensuring application of existing policies and legislation and to promote initiatives on the ground leading to sustainable management and use of biodiversity resources, it is recognised that it cannot do this alone.  DPWM hence works in close collaboration with other government agencies, NGOs and civil society partners.  Unfortunately, DPWM’s capacity to capitalize on the opportunities provided by this broader framework and to leverage resources (both human and financial) for the promotion of biodiversity development is severely constrained by the Department’s internal structural and functional challenges, weak staff capacity and implementation experience as well as by limited scientific and technical knowledge and insufficient funding. <br/><br/>Because of this globally significant biodiversity the GEF invested US$ 1 million to support the Integrated Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Management (ICAM) Project.  This project, which closed in March 2008, strengthened the coastal and marine protected area system and in-situ conservation of globally significant species and habitats. Through the project, coverage of the protected area system was expanded by 23%, including the legal designation of the Tanbi Wetland Complex as a National Park and the designation of the country’s first Community Wildlife Reserve at Bolong Fenyo.  In addition, the project developed and piloted innovative participatory approaches to conservation that have fostered ownership and commitment to the protected areas amongst local stakeholders.  These included the establishment of Site Management Committees as a counterpart to DPWM, and the provision of  grants for community sub-projects for bio-diversity friendly alternative livelihood activities. Two participatory management plans, one for each area, were prepared and validated by stakeholders and a participatory process for identification of community co-management and alternative livelihood projects was developed and tested.  Baseline studies were conducted and conservation action plans prepared for three endangered and threatened species:  marine turtles, manatees and dolphins, and related species monitoring databases were developed.  An institutional analysis was completed for DPWM, identifying human resource and organisational weaknesses and laying out a restructuring plan aimed at equipping DPWM with the human and institutional resources for implementing its mandate over the long term.  Lastly, the project contributed substantively to the development of stronger linkages with regional partners and networks.<br/><br/> While the ICAM project successfully put in place some of the building blocks for future conservation and management of coastal and marine protected areas in The Gambia, there remains a need for further consolidation of these gains.  The recommendations from the Institutional Analysis have yet to be implemented and, in the absence of this, DPWM’s ability to fulfil its mandate for biodiversity conservation and protected area management remains seriously constrained.  Government budgetary allocations are limited, potential revenue streams from the protected areas are untapped, and on-the-ground management is largely dependent upon a patchwork of donor-financed projects addressing specific parks, themes or species in accordance with the donors’ prevailing interests. Given this, in addition to improving the efficacy of departmental functioning and enhancing the skill base and incentive structures for its staff, there is also an urgent need to develop a strategic framework and business plan which determine concretely how the biodiversity and protected area management goals laid out in the broader vision documents such as the PRSP, GEAP, NBSAP and NASA are actually to be met by DPWM (and its partners) over the short, medium and long term.  <br/><br/> There are also challenges to be met on the ground.  Despite the significant gains made under ICAM, particularly regarding the legal status and participatory management framework for Tanbi and Bolong Fenyo, and management and monitoring of specific species, there is still a need to consolidate and build upon these initiatives and to expand the management effectiveness and participatory approaches developed under ICAM in order to meet the biodiversity conservation challenges in other protected areas.",

The recommendations from the Institutional Analysis have yet to be implemented and, in the absence of this, DPWM’s ability to fulfil its mandate for biodiversity conservation and protected area management remains seriously constrained.

					"summary": "The Gambia is endowed with rich natural resources, if properly managed, can make a considerable contribution to the global biodiversity targets. In order for Gambia to meet its requirements under the Convention of Biological Diversity and other related multi lateral environmental agreements, the following components of marine and coastal biodiversity and their management must be strengthened considerably.<br/><br/> However, the project seeks to address among others the climate induce problems such as coastal erosion, flooding, salinization, mangrove dieback etc. It will enhance poverty reduction for adjacent communities through sustainable land management and to address capacity needs. This will be achieved through enforcement of management strategies and awareness raising.<br/><br/>The project is expected to ensure effective and sustainable use of the Gambia’s marine and coastal resources and to contribute to address climate issues and enhanced improved community livelihood.",
					"description": "The Gambia contains globally significant biodiversity.  Although small in size, The Gambia harbors a wealth of terrestrial, coastal, marine and wetland habitats and species of local, national, regional and global significance.  The coastal and marine environment is defined in the Gambian context as not only those areas that border the Atlantic but also those with brackish water that border the River Gambia, extending 200km inland.  It is one of the areas identified as of particular importance in the GEAP and NBSAP. It is a natural resource rich area with particularly high biodiversity of national, regional and global environmental significance.  <br/><br/> Currently 4.9 per cent of Gambian national territory is legally protected, with the goal being set to increase this area to 10 per cent by 2020. The current formal protected area system comprises 7 national parks and nature reserves, under the mandate of the Department of Parks and Wildlife (DPWM), and is complemented by a community managed reserve, Bolong Fenyo, and as well as a series of forest reserves managed by the Department of Forestry together with local communities.  The protected area network is representative of the principal habitats and  ecosystems found in the country, and houses several habitats and rare and endangered species of global importance.  Habitat types within the protected area network include mangrove ecosystems, tidal zones, as well as guinea savannah and dry deciduous woodlands.  Mangrove and tidal areas serve as important spawning and nursery grounds for more than 114 species of coastal and marine fish, providing nesting and feeding habitats for endangered and threatened species such as migratory birds (East Atlantic Flyway), Audouin’s Gull (globally endangered), dolphins (including the Atlantic Humpback dolphin which is endemic to the Atlantic Ocean’s African coast), sharks, marine turtles (leatherback, loggerhead and green), the West African manatee, West African dwarf crocodile, West African red Colobus, clawless otter, hippopotamus, and others. In addition, more than 576 species of birds are identified in the Gambia among which 10% are migratory. Three of the Gambia’s protected areas are recognized as Wetlands of International importance under the RAMSAR convention: Tanbi Wetlands National Park, Niumi National Park and Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve. Six are recognised by the Birdlife International Partnership as Important Bird Areas:  Tanji, Tanbi, Abuko, Niumi, Bao Bolong and Kiang West , of which both Tanji and Niumi regularly surpass the 1 percent criteria for Royal terns, Caspian terns, and others. <br/><br/>The Gambia’s coastal and marine areas are under increasing pressure. A large proportion of the country’s population resides in coastal areas and depends upon them for their livelihoods.  Population growth and in-migration as a result of disrupted rainfall patterns and land degradation in the hinterland translates into growing pressure on coastal and marine resources.  Anthropogenic pressures arising from subsistence and small-scale economic exploitation include sand mining, fishing, clearing of forest and mangroves for fish-smoking, use as domestic fuel, arable crop production, and pastoralism.  There is also evidence of significant pressure on species of global and regional concern such as nesting and migratory birds and marine turtles, the eggs of which are frequently collected; sharks, harvested for their fins; and manatees, hunted for meat, as well as growing conflicts between the population and species such as hippopotamus as the two are increasingly forced to depend upon the same resources for survival.  The coast also is the primary tourism attraction of The Gambia, which alongside other economic development initiatives is increasing development pressure in this zone. <br/><br/>The project will initiate ABS strategies that will improve livelihoods of adjacent communities for enhancement of their participation towards conservation and sustainable use of coastal and marine biodiversity; it will include mainstreaming of gender issues. However, these strategies will gear towards addressing the objective of the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and their fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization.  <br/><br/>There is strong national commitment to protecting the country’s natural resources. DPWM is the government agency responsible for ensuring the management of the country’s protected area network as well as for the conservation of its biodiversity both within and outside this network.  While, DPWM is expected to take the lead in ensuring application of existing policies and legislation and to promote initiatives on the ground leading to sustainable management and use of biodiversity resources, it is recognised that it cannot do this alone.  DPWM hence works in close collaboration with other government agencies, NGOs and civil society partners.  Unfortunately, DPWM’s capacity to capitalize on the opportunities provided by this broader framework and to leverage resources (both human and financial) for the promotion of biodiversity development is severely constrained by the Department’s internal structural and functional challenges, weak staff capacity and implementation experience as well as by limited scientific and technical knowledge and insufficient funding. <br/><br/>Because of this globally significant biodiversity the GEF invested US$ 1 million to support the Integrated Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Management (ICAM) Project.  This project, which closed in March 2008, strengthened the coastal and marine protected area system and in-situ conservation of globally significant species and habitats. Through the project, coverage of the protected area system was expanded by 23%, including the legal designation of the Tanbi Wetland Complex as a National Park and the designation of the country’s first Community Wildlife Reserve at Bolong Fenyo.  In addition, the project developed and piloted innovative participatory approaches to conservation that have fostered ownership and commitment to the protected areas amongst local stakeholders.  These included the establishment of Site Management Committees as a counterpart to DPWM, and the provision of  grants for community sub-projects for bio-diversity friendly alternative livelihood activities. Two participatory management plans, one for each area, were prepared and validated by stakeholders and a participatory process for identification of community co-management and alternative livelihood projects was developed and tested.  Baseline studies were conducted and conservation action plans prepared for three endangered and threatened species:  marine turtles, manatees and dolphins, and related species monitoring databases were developed.  An institutional analysis was completed for DPWM, identifying human resource and organisational weaknesses and laying out a restructuring plan aimed at equipping DPWM with the human and institutional resources for implementing its mandate over the long term.  Lastly, the project contributed substantively to the development of stronger linkages with regional partners and networks.<br/><br/> While the ICAM project successfully put in place some of the building blocks for future conservation and management of coastal and marine protected areas in The Gambia, there remains a need for further consolidation of these gains.  The recommendations from the Institutional Analysis have yet to be implemented and, in the absence of this, DPWM’s ability to fulfil its mandate for biodiversity conservation and protected area management remains seriously constrained.

The constituent parks are surrounded by a mosaic of forested areas that double the total area of natural forest. These surrounding forests include a variety of different utilization purposes, have a high intrinsic value for biodiversity and create a buffer for the world heritage sites.<br/>Despite the protected status, this globally important forest resource is under considerable threat. The extremely high pressure from direct threats is reducing the natural resilience of the forests to climate change. This project will take the globally important natural world heritage sites of Sumatra and pilot an approach to predict climate change impacts and incorporate adaptation into management plans. The project will also develop and pilot REDD schemes in buffer areas to mitigate climate change and to provide a mechanism to alleviate direct threats.",

					"summary": "The Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra (THRS) was inscribed in the World Heritage List in 2004. The site comprises three national parks (Gunung Leuser, Kerinci-Seblat and Bukit Barisan Selatan) and is of outstanding biological value, covering a forested area of over 2.5 million ha and offering the last refuge for globally threatened species including tigers, sumatran rhino, elephants and orang-utan. The constituent parks are surrounded by a mosaic of forested areas that double the total area of natural forest. These surrounding forests include a variety of different utilization purposes, have a high intrinsic value for biodiversity and create a buffer for the world heritage sites.<br/>Despite the protected status, this globally important forest resource is under considerable threat. The extremely high pressure from direct threats is reducing the natural resilience of the forests to climate change. This project will take the globally important natural world heritage sites of Sumatra and pilot an approach to predict climate change impacts and incorporate adaptation into management plans. The project will also develop and pilot REDD schemes in buffer areas to mitigate climate change and to provide a mechanism to alleviate direct threats.",

		"description": "Micronesia’s highly diverse natural resources represent the capital for the local people, who serve as the traditional stewards of their land and sea. With over a half million people spread over 6.7 million square kilometres of ocean, the Micronesia region constitutes more than 20% of the Pacific Island region. Home to at least 66 known threatened species and 60% of all known corals, the annual net benefits from coral reefs in terms of fisheries, tourism, coastal protection and biodiversity, to the Pacific as a whole is estimated at $2 billion, with approximately $800 million worth of benefits annually distributed across Micronesia.<br/><br/>The natural features that make these island nations exceptional also make them especially vulnerable to the principle drivers of biodiversity loss and social poverty; habitat degradation, climate change, unsustainable fishing and extractive practices, and alien and invasive species. Without immediate action, localized and external threats will further degrade the very natural resources on which the people of Micronesia depend for their culture and livelihoods. A partnership led by IUCN’s World Commission on Protected Areas, PACT 2020: Protected Areas Climate Turnaround published Natural Solutions, which showcases multiple studies of how nature based adaptation, including the protection and sustainable use of natural resources , may be the most practical way to prepare these island communities to cope with the inevitable effects of climate change. Furthermore, BirdLife International provides guidance and direction on the value of enhancing the health of ecosystems that support these fragile island communities, to ensure ecosystem services will be available in times of drought, coastal inundation and increased pressure on the surrounding environments. Despite the value of these resources, the local authorities, organizations and communities responsible for managing them are often ill equipped to do so, given shifts from subsistence to cash economies, limited formal education, loss of traditional knowledge, and lack of technical expertise, experience and knowledge about technologies and advancements in management protocols.<br/><br/>The 4th Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report identifies the risks posed to island states with a high degree of confidence and assesses the severity of the impacts of climate change. Four key issues are raised specifically for island states, such as the Micronesian Countries:<br/><br/>• Sea level rise is expected to exacerbate inundation, storm surge, erosion and other coastal hazards, thus threatening vital infrastructure, settlements and facilities that support the livelihood of island communities.<br/><br/>• Deterioration in coastal conditions, e.g. through erosion of beaches and coral bleaching, is expected to affect local resources, including fish stocks with associated impacts on food security for island communities.<br/><br/>• By mid-century, climate change is expected to reduce water resources in many small islands, e.g. in the Pacific, to the point where they become insufficient to meet local demand during low-rainfall periods.<br/><br/>• With higher temperatures, increased invasion by non-native species is expected to occur.<br/><br/>Because of the fragile, finite, sometimes non-renewable, and irreplaceable nature of these resources, protection efforts are challenged by and subject to damage, loss, and destruction due to ignorance, insufficient management, uncontrolled development and land use, and foreign encroachment. In order to effectively manage these areas, increased knowledge among the people of Micronesia who are the main users and decision makers for the use of the resources found within these areas is critical. Because of the unique biodiversity, historic, archaeological, and cultural resources that form the legacy of Micronesia, the establishment of a better means of identifying and administering these resources is important, and encouragement for their preservation, study, and interpretation will improve the planning and execution of regional, national, state, local, and private undertakings, ultimately promoting sustainable economic growth and development.<br/><br/>In Micronesia, the identification and management of protected areas has always been part of culture and tradition, since they ensure the availability of food crops, fish, livestock, drinking water, building materials and all means essential to support livelihoods in communities. Through the Micronesia Challenge (MC), launched in 2006, the Republic of Palau, (ROP), the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), the Republic of Marshal Islands (RMI), the U. S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) and the U. S. Territory of Guam have committed to the effective conservation of at least 30% of their near-shore marine resources and 20% of their terrestrial resources. This commitment will result in the effective management, preservation and protection of areas identified as possessing unique biodiversity, historic, archaeological, and cultural properties.<br/><br/>This action will assist RMI, ROP, and FSM to advance their efforts in implementing the CBD Programme of Work on Protected Areas (PoWPA) and achieving the goals of the MC by significantly contributing to their sustainable financing systems for long-term management of their natural resources and providing financial, human and technical assistance to their on-going conservation efforts. These countries have also identified the establishment of protected areas network as their main strategy to deal with climate change and its associated threats, including food and water security, sea level rise, coastal integrity and invasive species risk. The action will abate these threats by improving effectiveness of existing protected areas and planning for new protected areas.<br/><br/>Because Micronesia will be one if the first regions to experience the realities of climate change, ecosystem resilience constitutes a major program goal of the MC. Carefully orchestrated and innovative solutions in the face of new, human-induced climate related impacts such as watershed protection, livelihood protection, food security, natural hazard mitigation and coastal protection methods must be transferred to local stakeholders. The enhanced resources and capacity of local NGOs and government agencies targeted through this action will help to ensure that the indigenous people of Micronesia maintain their traditional way of life.<br/><br/>Each country recognizes the most significant barrier facing effective biodiversity conservation, and timely climate change action across Micronesia is the lack of reliable, adequate and targeted financial resources. Establishing and sustaining representative networks of community-based protected areas cannot be achieved in the absence of sustainable financing, This LifeWeb Global Iniative on Protected Areas Action will develop and apply sustainable finance systems and policies that will provide long-term core resources for effective and adaptive conservation strategies across the country proponents of the Micronesia Challenge.<br/><br/>As a primary facet of this concept, the Action will provide comprehensive support to the existing Micronesia Conservation Trust (MCT) to develop the Micronesia Challenge financial architecture. This component will provide seed endowment capital of $6 million as well as demonstration of disbursement and grant-based support to catalyze and implement a strategic financing program for climate change adaptation efforts across the project region. <br/><br/>See FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY section and Annex 6 System Scale EOI for more explicit details.",

These areas represent the foundations of livelihoods, economic development and cultural preservation and protection of these special areas is necessary for the well-being of present and future generations. Establishment of nation-wide protected areas networks will help to ensure the resiliency of these ecosystems and the species that rely on them to withstand the impacts of climate change. Creating networks of these important areas will also help to ensure the maintenance and development of the economies, livelihoods, identity, pride, and integrity of the occupants of these islands, and globally of Micronesia’s unique biodiversity, history and culture.<br/><br/>Since the launching of the MC in 2006, the three MC countries have mobilized substantial resources in order to identify and prioritize areas for inclusion in protected areas networks to achieve the goals of the MC. This action will support the implementation of management activities at many of these important areas identified in Annex 1 Management plans will mainstream environmental conservation and climate change consideration into policy making at all levels, with the guiding principles of ensuring full participation of communities and fostering conditions under which modern society, biodiversity, and historic, archaeological, and cultural resources in Micronesia can exist in harmony to fulfill the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations.<br/><br/>National Gaps Analysis (Please refer to Annex7 for links to these documents)<br/><br/><br/>RMI: In response to the MC, RMI completed a National Conservation Area Plan for the Marshall Islands called “Reimaanlok”, looking to the future. Through the Reimaanlok, RMI was able to develop objectives for conservation, identify conservation targets, establish conservation goals and also define key concepts of what is “effective conservation”. The Reimaanlok was completed in April 2008 and serves as an overarching framework for conservation area planning through RMI. The Reimaanlok is also made part of RMI’s program of work for protected areas (POWPA) as required by the CBD. Efforts to continue the cohesion developed through the Reimaanlok to address environment conservation along with the adverse impacts of climate change is taking place throughout the Marshall Islands and are led by Marshallese who were proponents of the Reimaanlok along with both government, traditional leaders as well as church leaders.<br/>FSM: In 2003, in collaboration with its NGO and government partners, the FSM government completed an ecological assessment which resulted in the publication of “A Blueprint for Conserving the Biodiversity of the Federated States of Micronesia”. The vision of the FSM blueprint stated that “The FSM will have more extensive, diverse and higher quality of marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, which meet human needs and aspirations fairly, preserve and utilize traditional knowledge and practices, and fulfill the ecosystem functions necessary for all life on Earth.” The single multi-area conservation strategy recommended by this plan is to create a government framework that enables local communities to establish and maintain conservation areas. This strategy continues to serve as the underpinning of FSM’s continuing efforts in environment conservation. Throughout the FSM communities continue to be the focus of resource management efforts due to the key role they play as users and critical decision makers. In 2008, key FSM partners began a gap assessment based on the FSM blueprint and new data resulting from the 4 state marine rapid ecological assessments conducted between 2005 and 2008. State teams held planning meetings to review and compile: existing local, national, regional and international conservation strategies, plans, and reports (NBSAPs, CAPs, REAs, etc.); reference materials on gap assessment; and existing GIS data layers in preparation for a national workshop. Workshop objectives and outputs included a review and revision (as needed) of current biodiversity targets, areas of biodiversity significance, threats and opportunities; analyses and mapping of the occurrence and status of protected areas and their management (permitted and non permitted uses) in each state; identification of design criteria, stratification and conservation goals for a nation-wide Protected Areas Network; identification and prioritization of data gaps and gaps in protected areas, and development of strategies to fill these gaps; initial determination of baseline of % of existing areas under protection towards achieving the goals of the Micronesia Challenge; and strengthened State Teams and clearly identified next steps for each state and the national government (leads and timelines). The group also agreed on the planning units (hexagons, 10 hectares in size) to be used to complete an initial run using MARXAN software to assist with identification of gaps. Follow-up workshops were held in all 4 states in 2009, and MARXAN results are currently being compiled for final review by state and national partners in early 2010.<br/><br/>ROP: During a consultative process in Palau from 2002-2007, key partners from state and national government, and NGOs developed an ecoregional plan and gap analysis to guide and assist in the development of Palau’s protected areas network. The process included several workshops to summarize existing biodiversity data, develop an agreed set of protected area design principles, stratification, conservation targets, goals, and cost surface where socioeconomic data were used to determine those areas most favorable and least favorable for the establishment of protected areas, and assess protected areas network scenarios using the planning software MARXAN. A total of 39 targets were used in the analysis, including 16 marine or coastal systems, 10 terrestrial systems, 3 freshwater aquatic, 4 aggregation areas of multiple species, 5 focal areas for individual species (hawksbill turtle, green turtle, dugong, saltwater crocodile, fruit bat) and one coastline feature. Conservation goals were established for all 39 targets and agreed on by workshop participants. Additional data gaps and solutions to fill these were also identified, including state-level planning efforts which are currently being conducted.",

		"participation": "Historically, indigenous and local communities across Micronesia served as primary managers and stewards of the natural resources. Traditional systems were once adequate to manage the resources for local subsistence. Marine and land tenure are still viewed as of the utmost importance to familial lineage, societal structure, and livelihoods. However, with populations increasing exponentially, and the increased availability of refrigeration and transportation, resources are under pressure from export, commercial sale, and overharvest.<br/><br/>This action will support governments, resource managers, and communities to work together to bridge the gap between science and traditional environmental knowledge, in designing community-based solutions to address critical threats. The community-based adaptive management approach utilized across the region involves multiple stakeholders in participatory, decision-making processes. This approach encourages local management of protected areas, helping to ensure greater long-term sustainability and more equitable sharing of benefits from the improved ecosystem services by the entire community. In addition to developing strategies to achieve conservation goals, previous management planning has resulted in formulation of sustainable financing strategies , such as the development of alternative livelihoods (e.g. ecotourism) and income generating mechanisms (e.g. collection of “green fees”) . These strategies are also aimed at sharing financial benefits within the community. Although distance and capacity are a challenge to effectively managing these areas, the provision of additional financial and human resources from government and non-government agencies to local communities will likely reduce the loss of biodiversity, including targeted food species, while ensuring communities have the resources they need to conduct monitoring and enforcement for their designated marine and terrestrial protected areas.<br/>Full and effective participation is the driving force through which this action will propel the Micronesia Challenge by providing:<br/><br/>• Greater opportunities for national agencies and local communities to work together;<br/><br/>• Regional coordination and communication necessary for each jurisdiction to effectively participate in meeting the goals of the MC;<br/><br/>• Equitable sharing of cost and benefits by key players involved in discussion, planning, implementation and reporting stages of this project;<br/><br/>• Streamlined and efficient implementation of activities;<br/><br/>• Opportunities for communities to share and highlight results of their work; and<br/><br/>• Opportunities to organize communities from 3 countries (as well as from 2 U.S. protectorates), to work together towards a united vision as one region under the Micronesia Challenge.",

The MC Action Plan (2006) guides the multilateral effort, and the communications and measures working group also work from planning documents, to drive the effort within all 5 jurisdictions, including the 3 countries specific to this action.<br/><br/>In addition to the regional planning documents associated with the inception of the Micronesia Challenge, a clear relationship exists between the actions described in this expression and several existing national plans. The following plans all identify the necessity for capacity building toward the development of resilient, legally sanctioned networks of protected areas. In FSM, nation-wide collaboration and support for conservation was initiated with the establishment of the President’s Council on Environmental Management and Sustainable Development (SD Council)i in 1995, followed by the adoption of the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) in 2002, and both the Strategic Development Plan (SDP) and the FSM National Implementation Support Partnership (NISP) in 2004. FSM also developed a draft sustainable finance plan to support the recurring and projected costs and potential benefits of a protected areas network in 2008. In 2000, the RMI developed their NBSAP. RMI’s National Vision is also expressed in “Vision 2018”, of the Marshall Islands Strategic Economic Development Plan for 2003-2018. Palau developed their NBSAP between 2002 and 2004, passed the Palau Protected Area Network (PAN) Act in 2003, and produced a sustainable finance plan in 2005 that led to the passing of “Green Fee” legislation to capture financial resources and mainstream public investments. A regional MC Business Plan to support the financial needs of all five MC jurisdictions is nearing completion. A Regional Climate Change Workshop held in Marshall Islands in 2009 spurred interest from FSM to hold focused meetings for FSM counterparts and RMI traditional leaders to begin discussions on how to incorporate climate issues into current development and natural resources management protocols. As party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, all jurisdictions completed their Initial National Communication, and are nearing completion for the second communication, which detail what threats stem from scenarios, respective climate change preparations, vulnerability assessments and adaptation policies.

		"summary": "Rwanda’s National Park “Forêt de Nyungwe” is the largest montane cloud forest in eastern Africa and hosts many unique species. However, in this densely populated country these areas are under considerable pressure for use. Therefore, a sustainable intensification of agricultural and forestry production in the adjacent zones to the cloud forest is indispensible if the pressure on the forest resources is to be reduced.  The goal of this project is to conserve biodiversity and the functionality of the forest, which is both a CO2 sink and of vital importance for the region's water balance, by ensuring a smooth transformation to sustainable agriculture and forestry in the adjacent zones of the protected area. The establishment of agroforestry systems which simulate the forests' natural canopy levels, protect the soil from erosion and guarantee a high biomass yield per area unit, will render logging superfluous. This project is an important contribution to enhancing food security of small-scale farmers.",

By waterlogging bog areas again, further greenhouse gas emissions can be prevented. However, this approach is not yet much used in Ukraine. Within the framework of this project, at least 20,000 ha of degraded bog areas are to be renaturalised. Moreover, parts of the newly waterlogged areas are to be integrated into protected areas to support Ukraine’s ambitious nature conservation program. The newly waterlogged bog areas will not only be of benefit with regard to the climate but also with regard to enhancing biological diversity. The use of biomass and other measures in these newly waterlogged areas can also contribute to improving the incomes of the local population. The establishment of a sustainable financing mechanism is to serve as an incentive for the Ukrainian government to continue to waterlog bog areas once the project has been concluded. Waterlogging also helps to reduce the negative health impact of fires on drained bog areas as these release radioactivity from the Chernobyl accident.",

		"description": "The Atiquipa lomas are property of 513 families distributed in three towns: Atiquipa, Santa Rosa and Agua Salada, which are all associated to the Atiquipa Peasant Community. The Atiquipa Community owns more than 17,000 hectares, including 10,000 hectares of loma formations (of an original cover of almost 100,000 hectares). Land is collectively managed, following traditional practices. The most extended and profitable economic activity in the area is extensive livestock production. Agriculture activities are marginal due to water scarcity and the traditional prioritization of water use in the area: human consumption in the first place, livestock in the second and agriculture in the last.<br/><br/>With the establishment of the Atiquipa Peasant Community 100 years ago, local inhabitants tried to make a shift in the management of the lomas, which were heavily degraded since the end of the Inca rule due to intensive use and the introduction of exotic flora and fauna. The new management model included the use of diversified agriculture, family agricultural plots, water resources management and reduction of livestock activities using seasonal ranching for bovine livestock. However, during the second half of the 20th century, chronic drought and economic crisis put new pressure on the lomas through the replacement of cows by goats, managed in extensive production systems; the clearance of forest to produce livestock fodder and the progressive abandonment of all major agriculture activities, with the exception of olive production. As a result of such situation, the loma forest was reduced to its current extension of only 1,500 hectares, 70% of which is sparse forest, agriculture areas were also reduced to only 70 hectares, as well as pasture lands which dropped to 800 hectares. Local population had to migrate to other areas in search of labor and new economic opportunities, leaving the Atiquipa Lomas scarcely populated.<br/><br/>Negative effects of deforestation and overgrazing are severe and combined with limited availability of water are producing a major shift at the landscape level. Fragmentation and habitat loss are causing the decline of the populations of certain species, including invertebrates such as the river crab (Hypolobocera sp.). Fragmentation, especially of the remaining forest, is also reducing the fog-catchment area (trees and shrubs) and disturbing the natural hydrological cycle of an area that is the only source of good quality freshwater in 200 kilometers around.<br/><br/>The current project aims for the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of the Atiquipa lomas, with active participation of the Atiquipa Peasant Community and through the development of activities in three lines of action: 1) biodiversity conservation, 2) water resources management and 3) climate change adaptation.<br/><br/>The project will build on previous successful experiences in conservation and sustainable management of the loma ecosystems such as the “Conservation and sustainable use of the loma ecosystems of Atiquipa and Taimara by local communities”, project funded by GEF until 2006 and which allowed for: i) the delimitation of areas for conservation, restoration, pasture management and silviculture, ii) establishment and recovery of fog-catchment and water storage systems, iii) establishment of meteorological facilities, iv) improved livestock management and v) training in new productive activities such as apiculture, dairy products and other.<br/><br/>The project is fully aligned with national priorities for in-situ biodiversity conservation defined by the National Service of Natural Protected Areas (SERNANP), since Atiquipa Lomas has been identified as one of the most important areas for conservation in the last gap analysis study done during the update process of the protected areas Master Plan. The area has also been identified as priority by the Arequipa Regional government, which is starting the process for the establishment of its system of protected areas.<br/><br/>The aim of the project in the promotion of sustainable economic activities by local settlers is in line with the Financial Plan for the National System of Protected Areas, which identifies these kinds of activities as means to ensure financial sustainability of protected areas in the long term. <br/><br/>The project will also build biodiversity management capacities at the local level, an issue in line with the co-management approach that the new protected areas authority and the recently established Ministry of the Environment are strongly promoting.",

		"description": "Introduction - Project Area Description<br/><br/>In the forested regions of western Tanzania two project sites with protected areas at their core include communities that depend on and are essential for future sustainability and improved effectiveness of these protected areas.  Yet these communities threaten the viability of the forest and freshwater upon which they depend.<br/><br/>The Greater Gombe Ecosystem (GGE) includes Gombe National Park and 14 villages between Kigalye in the south to the Burundi border in the north, and is bordered in the west by Lake Tanganyika.  The future viability of Gombe National Park is completely dependent on land use and the ability to reverse threats outside of the park in these 14 villages.  <br/><br/>The Greater Mahale Ecosystem (GME) with Mahale Mountains National Park (MMNP) at its core, is part of the globally recognized Eastern Afromontane biodiversity hotspot. The GME covering an area of 19,500 km2 with resident chimpanzee and elephant populations is currently characterized by low human population density, limited market access and poor infrastructure, although this situation is changing rapidly.  The GME includes 14,300 km2 (about 75% of the total area) of woodland and forest, woody biomass which constitutes an important carbon store. The dense tropical evergreen forest is typical of tall closed canopy gallery forests with a diverse species assemblage while the extensive Miombo woodlands are less biologically diverse and are adapted and maintained by fire. Important forest and woodland areas in the ecosystem include Ntakata Forest and mountain range, the Masito - Ugalla area including Tongwe East Forest Reserve and the Wansisi Hills, all of these are critical wildlife habitat and offer important ecosystem services to growing human populations.  Both Gombe and Mahale ecosystems are a high conservation priority for Government because these are the only National Parks with Chimps in Tanzania.<br/><br/>Problem Statement<br/><br/>One of the primary ongoing pressures on these landscapes is the uncontrolled harvesting of natural resources by an expanding human population.  This region’s population growth rate is 4.8%, one of the highest in Tanzania. The region also has one of the lowest per capita incomes in the country, as low as $150 per year, with low rates of literacy and school completion, which contribute to the extreme pressure on natural resources. The rapidly growing and economically disadvantaged population has frequently engaged in unsustainable agricultural practices, particularly extensive shifting cultivation, which results in the fragmentation and loss of forests and woodlands as they are converted to fields, and the inappropriate cultivation of steep hillsides, which results in sedimentation of aquatic habitats. In addition, unsustainable levels of wood extraction for fuel and timber are major contributors to the degradation of forests and woodlands.<br/><br/>Analysis of remote sensing data shows that in the areas near Gombe National Park approximately 50% of the natural forest and woodland was lost between 1991 and 2003, making the rate of deforestation more than three times as high as that experienced by the country as a whole during the same period.  Although the rate of deforestation in the GME has been slower (11% between 2001 and 2007), it is at risk of increasing quickly due to the rapidly growing population in the area and a steadily improving infrastructure of roads allowing access to more remote areas of the landscape.  As these forests and woodlands become fragmented and disappear, the long-term survival of globally important endangered species like chimpanzees in the region is severely threatened.  Climate change will exacerbate these threats increasing pressure on an already over burdened system.  To reverse the trend of forest loss and environmental degradation and to ensure sustainable utilization and protection, it will be necessary to support sustainable economic growth across both ecosystems to ensure that lessening pressures in one area does not simply transfer the problems of human impact into the adjacent ecosystem.<br/><br/>Interventions<br/><br/>Project partners believe that the best way to achieve both economic development and biodiversity conservation in rural landscapes is to address the two simultaneously while both involving and empowering the local population to make responsible natural resource management decisions.  In a participatory process facilitated by The Nature Conservancy, both landscapes have a Conservation Action Plan that identifies key ecosystem values, evaluates the health of those values, ranks the threats facing them and defines conservation strategies to abate those threats.  The conservation strategies and monitoring frameworks developed in this process will enable project funds to be spent efficiently with quantifiable outcomes in the near term.  <br/><br/>Village land use planning and Capacity Building – conduct participatory village land use planning to reduce unplanned settlements and improve agricultural practices to reduce deforestation, erosion and contamination of freshwater sources.  <br/><br/>Human Livelihoods - Conduct conservation friendly business development training and support linkages to local, regional and national markets.  Fisheries management training, including establishment of fisheries management committees, capacity building, resource assessments, demarcation, management planning, and bye law preparation.<br/><br/>Environmental Education and Awareness – Introduction of youth environmental education programs will be complimented with village level agricultural and forestry extension services focused on sustainability, and carefully targeted HIV/AIDS education. These initiatives will establish a network of local community educators, who will train their peers, promote environmental awareness, and distribute appropriate education and awareness materials.<br/><br/>Improve protection - Currently less than 10% of the terrestrial area of the GME (only 1517 km2) is strictly protected.  There are several forest reserves (Uvinza, Tongwe East and Mkamba) and some newly established community managed areas, these all require capacity building and management strengthening. Much of the remaining GME is unregistered central government land (general land) which includes areas of prime habitat, evergreen forest (areas such as Ntakata, Masito Ugalla and Wansisi Hills) and large mammal migration routes between existing protected areas.  Working with the Tanzania Department of Forestry and Beekeeping and the Tanzania National Parks Authority to increase protection of these areas is critical.  Protection will be increased by creating Community Based Organizations (Nationally registered) that will provide community forest monitors to patrol and monitor illegal incidents in the forest.<br/><br/>Increase Climate Change Resilience - Climate change data will be analyzed to understand, predict, and ultimately mitigate the projected impact on conservation and development plans in the landscape. Particular attention will be paid to the impact of climate change on fresh water systems within the landscape, as rivers and streams form a critical component of the economic and social fiber of communities in the landscape, and current climate models predict significant increases in temperatures and corresponding decreases in precipitation across the region. This activity will help the stakeholders in the landscape evaluate how the changes impact the viability of conservation targets, the severity of threats, and how the impacts of climate change can be measured.  Additionally climate adaptation strategies will be developed in an effort to increase the ecological and human resilience to climate changes.<br/><br/>Project interventions will be consistent with and support policies and strategic goals of the Tanzanian Government while being guided by and prioritized by the Conservation Action Planning processes.  Policies and plans supported include: the Forest Policy (1998), the Forest Act no 14 of 2002, the National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (MKUKUTA), Wildlife Policy and the Wildlife Conservation Act no 12 (1974), and the 1997 National Environmental Management Policy.",

		"description": "OVERALL CONTEXT: <br/><br/>During the 2003 World Parks Congress in Durban, South Africa, Madagascar’s President Marc Ravalomanana announced a bold new national policy to triple the size of the Protected Area (PA) network from 1.7 million hectares to 6 million hectares through the creation of new PAs representing a wide range of natural habitats, including freshwater and marine/coastal ecosystems. The new policy became known as the Durban Vision and resulted in the creation of the Madagascar Protected Areas System (SAPM), with  responsibility for coordinating its implementation designated to the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MEF).   As part of this new approach, the GOM, through SAPM, looks beyond  traditional PA site-based planning and implementation to an increased focus on longer-term integration of PAs into regional development frameworks coupled with a direct management partnership with local communities.<br/><br/>The GOM recognizes the importance of the nation’s biodiversity and its role in social and economic development.  SAPM is a clear statement of this commitment and requires that all PAs are to be integrated into both national and regional planning.  The high profile of PAs is thus strengthened and their long-term security is enhanced through political support and goodwill.   Further, PAs can work with their respective regions, together with their component districts and communes, to deal with threats, risks or opportunities that the site managers alone could not address.  For example, illegal logging may be a threat to a given PA but their root causes are driven by urban demand within the region; in such a case, a regional solution is required.  <br/><br/>SAPM also recognizes the role of local communities in long-term sustainability of PAs, and    Madagascar National Parks (MNP), such as Masoala National Park, are increasingly implicating neighboring communities in the management of parks and their peripheral zones.   New PAs, including Makira Natural Park, will be implemented through a co-management sharing arrangement between the local communities and the Forest Service.  <br/><br/>In alignment and harmony with the GOM’s orientation, Wildlife Conservation Society’s (WCS) vision for the conservation of Madagascar’s last great wilderness is that MaMaBay’s abundant and diverse flora and fauna thrive in contiguous and effectively protected forests, mangroves, and coral reefs, buffered and connected by community areas that support sustainable forestry, agriculture and fisheries. MaMaBay, with the country’s two largest protected areas, is as an ideal land/seascape to scale up this forward thinking dynamic approach toward achieving resource conservation and realizing biodiversity protection through the directed involvement of the local communities in the improved stewardship of protected areas and the surrounding terrestrial, coastal an marine resources.<br/><br/>This approach is a direct response to the three barriers identified during the PoWPA assessment by the GOM and its partners: (1) address pressing socio-economic activities as a complement to protected area management and conservation activities in priority land/seascapes; (2) develop a systematic capacity building program for stakeholder groups; and (3) inform an adaptive management process that link threats analysis and biodiversity conservation through field based participatory monitoring.   <br/><br/>In line with the GOM’s new orientation and guidelines for PA management and the creation of an enabling environment, the proposed activities will focus primarily on empowering community management of protected areas and the surrounding environment to ensure the long term function and integrity of the socio-ecological MaMaBay land/seascape and linking this community-based management to local and regional economic development activities.  Success will be achieved through reinforcing the transfer of management of natural resources to local communities in and around the protected areas; expanding forestry, farmer and fishermen associations; and promoting sustainable resources use, eco-agriculture techniques and sustainable fisheries to improve livelihoods.   The program of work will further advance the critically important integration of local populations through capacity building and the development of local governance structures, and a field based participative monitoring and control program by the communities to better address threats.<br/><br/>THREATS AND CHALLENGES:  <br/><br/>MaMaBay faces many challenges – growing demands for agricultural land, intensive bushmeat hunting, illegal logging, unchecked and unsustainable fishing and expanding oil and gas industries. As productivity of the land is increasingly diminished by poor planning and land-use practices, more people turn to the forest and the sea for their livelihoods.<br/><br/>With 230,000 local inhabitants whose livelihoods depend on the forest’s ecosystem service, and population pressure increasing at almost 3% annually, the risk of deforestation for subsistence agriculture is enormous.   Past anarchic rural development has resulted in the loss of critical terrestrial, coastal and marine and decreased livelihood security.  In the absence of viable terrestrial resource management regimes, the Makira-Masoala landscape risks losing over 1,500 ha of forest to agriculture annually. This threat of land cover change as a direct result of slash and burn agriculture is also a significant threat to the integrity of ‘down stream’ coastal and marine systems for Antongil Bay.  Local fishermen compete with unregulated industrial fishing operations, resulting in an unsustainable open access race that is depleting marine resources.<br/>The threat of slash and burn agriculture is being addressed through active engagement with the farming population through a program of improved agro-ecological techniques that will stabilize the hillsides and decrease erosion.  These efforts have resulted in the creation of community platforms for conflict resolution and shared learning across a range of stakeholders to improve natural resources management. Among the most significant outcomes is the establishment of the Platform for the Sustainable Development of the Antongil Bay (PCDDBA) that assembles decentralized authorities, local associations and the private sector around the common vision of a sustainable ‘ridge to reef’ resource management plan linking decreased upstream erosion through implementation of improved agricultural techniques to stabilized coastal and marine systems.     <br/>Equally, with a high demand for valuable timber such as rosewood and ebony on the international market, well organized illicit extraction of these species has escalated as a result of the current political crisis.   New illegal traffic routes have appeared and the demand for forest products, arable land and marine resources has increased.   As a result, buffer forests surrounding the protected areas are being depleted at an alarming rate, and the protected areas themselves are now exposed to direct illegal logging.   One key strategy to address this increasing threat is to directly engage the local communities in sustainable management of their terrestrial and marine resources through participatory monitoring and control. <br/><br/>In navigating this socio-ecological system, WCS in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment and Forest, (MEF) the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, (MAEP) and Madagascar National Parks (formerly ANGAP) have strived to develop the MaMaBay Bay Land/Seascape as a holistic model for achieving conservation and development through a comprehensive zoning plan that links protected areas, community forests, agricultural and coastal zones.  Community engagement in resource management has become a key approach by protected area managers in addressing these land based threats that affect terrestrial, coastal and marine resources as an integral part of the overall conservation approach.",

During the recent REA, a total of 338 confirmed species of hard coral were recorded and an additional 41 taxa remain to be confirmed (Turak and DeVantier 2009). In addition, a total number of 520 taxa of reef-associated fish were recorded (Musburger 2009). Verheij and Prud’homme van Reine (2009) recorded 9 species of seagrasses and 163 taxa of algae of which 68 taxa are new records for Palau. Dr. Alan Olsen recorded on one of the small islands north of Ngarchelong State 21 bird species, of which 7 are endemics. During the REA, signs of overfishing and illegal fishing of sharks were observed and the proposed project will address these issues. In addition, the REA also concluded that many of the reefs in the Northern Reefs area are showing resilience to climate change, which the proposed project will enhance.<br/><br/>The Northern Reefs area includes a large number of marine habitat types, including seagrass beds, algal flats, barrier reefs, fringing reefs, patch reefs, atolls, sunken atoll, lagoon areas, small sand spits/islands, and small volcanic rock islands.<br/><br/>The recently completed first iteration of the Conservation Action Planning (CAP) for Ngarchelong state identified the following major threats for the area: overfishing from commercial fishing practices and climate change. The proposed activities focus on addressing the threat of overfishing, and while the area has shown in 1998 to be resilient to climate change, the conservation efforts will focus on enhancing the resilience of these reefs.

		"description": "Introduction and Project Area Description<br/><br/>The middle reach of the Zambezi River, from Chirundu, Zambia, to the river’s entry into Mozambique, is renowned for its wildlife diversity and abundance. This spectacular area, visited by thousands of tourists from around the world each year, hosts some of Africa’s best remaining populations of Nile crocodile, hippopotamus, African elephant, and African buffalo, and is also home to wild dog, lion, leopard, eland, sable and Lichtenstein’s hartebeest. The river corridor is dominated by mopane woodlands, while the uplands, rising to the Zambezi Escarpment, are vegetated by miombo woodland, a forest type that is in decline throughout its range due to charcoal production and too-frequent burning.<br/><br/>The project area is the proposed Chiawa Partnership Park (CPP), a community- and leaseholder-managed protected area adjacent to Lower Zambezi National Park and across the Zambezi River from Zimbabwe’s Mana Pools National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The CPP represents a new protected area category in Zambia. It will be Zambia’s first partnership park, managed by and for the local community in collaboration with the Zambia Wildlife Authority and private leaseholders who reside in the protected area. The CPP and adjacent Lower Zambezi National Park are national conservation priorities, having been recognized nationally and internationally as one of Africa’s only protected large river floodplains  <br/><br/>The proposed new park covers more than 100 square kilometers of mopane and miombo woodland. Its northern boundary is demarcated by the magnificent Zambezi escarpment, and the southern boundary is the Zambezi River. Lower Zambezi National Park and the CPP together protect approximately 250 square kilometers of Zambezi River valley habitat. The adjacent Chiawa Game Management Area is home to 18,000-20,000 people of the Goba ethnic group, people who have traditionally made their living through traditional flood-recession agriculture and fishing.<br/><br/>Problem Statement<br/><br/>The area where the Chiawa Partnership Park will be located has been, to date, jointly managed by the community and the Zambia Wildlife Authority as a Game Management Area (GMA) for the purpose of wildlife conservation and community economic development. As documented in a recent report of Zambia’s Natural Resources Consultative Forum, this and other GMAs have failed to meet these objectives. Instead, wildlife is in decline due to habitat loss and poaching, and the community’s health and livelihoods have declined, as well. Human-wildlife conflict has increased, causing resentment of the National Park, the GMA, and wildlife managers, and skepticism regarding the value of nature conservation. <br/><br/>Moreover, only modest benefits have accrued to the community to date from the more than twenty tourism operations that have been established along the river in the GMA, creating further conflict between community interests and conservation efforts. In spite of its proximity to one of the continent’s largest hydroelectric power plants (Kariba Dam), this rural community is not electrified, and its growing population consumes more charcoal every year for cooking and home lighting, resulting in degradation and loss of the surrounding riverside and upland forests. <br/><br/>For these reasons, and because of increasing foreign investments in tourism, mining and hunting, effective conservation of the Middle Zambezi corridor requires community development that is explicitly linked to conservation.<br/><br/><br/>Interventions<br/><br/>In 2005, the Zambian Government, with assistance from United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF), initiated a national Reclassification and National Protected Areas System Project to develop and test innovative new conservation models. The Lower Zambezi Management Unit was selected as one of two national priorities for reclassification and reform of protected areas management based on its high biodiversity value, growing threats to the values that the unit was established to protect, and high potential for economic and ecological sustainability based on ecotourism and local community enterprises. <br/><br/>The proposed Chiawa Partnership Park is a direct result of the UNDP-GEF initiative; it emerged from years of discussion and planning involving local communities, the private sector and government. This effort also led to the formation of the Lower Zambezi Conservation Trust (LZCT), a partnership between the community, the Zambia Wildlife Authority and private leaseholders. LZCT is expected to take full responsibility for managing Chiawa Partnership Park once the legal formalities have been finalized.<br/><br/>LZCT’s goal is to establish a management program that leads to economic and ecological sustainability for the CPP, and that establishes a balance between community development and wildlife and habitat conservation. Objectives include:<br/><br/>• Protect, restore and reintroduce populations of native animals.<br/>• Protect forests and woodlands as sources of diversity, abundance and livelihoods.<br/>• Improve community livelihoods and health without undermining the natural resources that are the foundation for wealth generation.<br/>• Improve community awareness of the importance and status of the areas’ magnificent and globally significant natural resources.<br/>• Ensure good public governance and management of natural resources in collaboration with the local communities and the private sector<br/><br/>In recent months, the newly-established LZCT has planned several interventions. (Those for which we are requesting funds through this project are shown below.)<br/><br/>• Development of a stakeholder-driven Conservation Action Plan that integrates community development with conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services (e. g., reintroduction of lost species such as sable, road, eland, black rhino and cheetah).<br/>• Establishment of a research and monitoring program that measures the success of LZCT conservation and economic strategies.<br/>• Capacity-building for the new partnership park: recruitment, hiring and training of professional managers, rangers, naturalists and anti-poaching guards, many of whom will be drawn from the Chiawa community. <br/>• Reduction of deforestation for charcoal production through rural solar electrification.<br/>• Economic development, community pride, and food security projects, including:<br/>             o Community protected gardens and fields (a successful 10-hectare demonstration farm has already   <br/>                been created).<br/>             o Small-scale commercial fish farms.<br/>             o Craft businesses and professional training for women (already launched).<br/>             o Commercial apiary.<br/>             o Boat transport business for the local tourism industry.",

		"description": "Tsitongambarika (TGK) forest is home to a high diversity of species, including many endemics. These biodiversity values are being steadily eroded due to unsustainable use of forest resources, clearance of forest for shifting cultivation, associated fires and charcoal production. The underlying cause of these threats is food insecurity among local, forest-dependent communities, exacerbated by steady decline and siltation of water sources for irrigation as a result of deforestation. The potential negative effects of deforestation and degradation to ecosystem services extend well beyond the immediate TGK forest area. TGK forest degradation threatens water catchment protection to nearby town of Tolagnaro (Fort Dauphin). Also, several rivers and springs, which are the main sources of domestic, industrial and irrigation water for other downriver populations, are threatened. This might undermine the projected major economic development of Tolagnaro town, which has been designated as one of three major economic growth poles by the Malagasy Government in partnership with the World Bank. The following specific problems flow from the overall problem described above:<br/>Intrinsic Biodiversity Problem - The disappearance of the lowland humid forest ecosystem of TGK would constitute a loss of the largest remaining area of this highly threatened and diverse vegetation type in Southern Madagascar, as well as a number of species endemic to the SE, and even to TGK itself, and many more that are poorly, if at all, represented in existing PAs.<br/>Resources, Knowledge and Cultural Motivation Problem - There is a lack of resources and capacity within national NGOs and government authorities to manage PAs. New, flexible models are required to spread good practice and value based motivation. <br/>Lack of Private Sector Engagement Problem - Like many other developing countries, Madagascar is experiencing accelerating economic growth, with associated pressures on natural ecosystems. The mining sector alone is predicted to grow from 4% to 30% of GDP by 2012. There is a pressing need to engage the private sector in multi-sectoral partnerships with government and civil society that extend well beyond compliance with environmental regulations and generate new sources for biodiversity conservation. <br/>Natural resources overexploitation Problem - Local communities exert the main direct pressures on forest resources in Madagascar. The unsustainable use of forest resources is driven by demand for fuel-wood, charcoal production, medicinal plants, bushmeat and land for agricultural production. The precarious living conditions, and, in particular, low levels of food security, typical of forest-adjacent communities, only exacerbate the depletion of forest resources, since these communities have very limited alternative livelihood options.  If action is not taken quickly, the natural resource base that underpins local livelihoods and provides a safety net during times of food shortages will be depleted. <br/>The most sustainable solution to all these problems is, as described in this proposal, the effective management of TGK as a participatory Protected Area (PA), which will also offer powerful lessons to other practitioners in the immediate area and beyond.",

Also, the government of the Anosy Region elected TGK as a priority site for inclusion in the expanded system of national PAs. From a global perspective, Madagascar is a Least Developed Country (LDC) undergoing both rapid population growth (approx. 3% per year) and rapid deforestation (i.e. only 9.9% of the island’s original vegetation remains and less than 20% of that is formally protected).",

Villages are represented by local community management committees that have been granted the management of the forest through “Transferts de Gestion”. Also, Asity Madagascar, the main implementing National NGO Partner, has a history of strong roots into the community. The Government of Madagascar encourages National NGOs to play a leading role in the implementation of actions including capacity building to improve conservation results.  In order to strengthen this, BirdLife International will provide continual mentoring support to Asity Madagascar on key project activities. In addition, there will be a particular focus on the inclusion of women in the local structures for PA management and also in the participatory ecological monitoring teams. All Partners are committed to the promotion of gender mainstreaming and equal opportunities in the implementation of the Action. The traditional community elders and leaders will be more fully integrated into these local management structures too, in order for them to take responsibility and be effective at forest management. After careful discussion from village to national level, it is agreed that villagers will be compensated for well-documented opportunity and direct costs of participation; flat-rate per diems and salaries will not be paid. Finally, there is potential for economic growth in the communities adjacent to the Action. However, even if these changes bring the promise of development for many, they also represent a threat of increased marginalisation of the most vulnerable members of society, who are the least well prepared to take advantage of the new economic opportunities. In this context, it is significant that the Action will work with some of the most economically marginalised sections of Anosy society - indigenous, forest-adjacent communities - and that it will pay particular attention to providing them with a voice and the means (through, for example, the establishment of local management structures for the new PA) to influence and respond to change when it occurs. Overall, the ability of local communities to sustainably manage forest resources will be strengthened, and they will be provided with appropriate tools to capture more of the socio-economic benefits that will arise from the conservation of TGK. Sustainable management will offer new opportunities, especially valuing the ecosystem goods and services provided by the forest and their sustainable utilisation by the local populations.",

This process is critical for facilitating the proposed activities in the Action TGK and will continue in parallel and in addition to Action TGK objectives. In terms of long term sustainable financing by the end of project year, at least 2 partnerships with EAZA members and at least two other long-term financing mechanisms (e.g. endowment fund, carbon credit, etc) will be investigated for the new PA.

Action TGK aims to respond to the third identified barrier, more specifically: Barrier 2) PAs may be perceived to be less important among key actors than other pressing social and economic activities. Action TGK objectives prioritise the involvement of local communities and other relevant stakeholders to satisfactorily improve perceptions of PA protection and its related benefits. In addition, two of the three most commonly identified PA threats are addressed by the Action, they are: 1) “Natural habitat loss, fragmentation and isolation” and 2) “Subsistence overexploitation, collection and hunting”.

		"description": "The following is derived from the Executive Summary of Afghanistan Fourth National Report to the Convention on Biological Diversity (attached) and describes the overall environmental challenges facing Afghanistan.<br/>There are 137 - 150 species of mammals, 428 - 515 birds, 92 – 112 reptiles, only 6 – 8 amphibians, 101 – 139 fish, 245 butterflies, and 3500 – 4000 vascular plant species native to Afghanistan. Ranges reflect uncertainty in taxonomy and the questionable validity of some records. Estimates for endemic plant species are as high as 30%. Basic biological survey work and synthesis needs to be done to fully understand the diversity of the country’s organisms.<br/><br/>Biodiversity appears to be declining at an accelerating rate throughout Afghanistan. Satellite image analysis and assessment of commercial wood volumes show that forests, both closed forest and open woodlands, are rapidly disappearing. Overgrazing and shrub collection for fuel is markedly reducing plant biomass and altering plant communities. Diversion of water and increasingly frequent drought is drying wetlands and rivers with unknown effects on aquatic biodiversity. The ubiquity of weapons following years of war is leading to the loss of large mammals throughout much of the country. Ecological footprint analysis shows that Afghanistan’s per capita biocapacity is declining. Large scale remote sensing analysis suggests that nearly 8000 km² of land was degraded between 1981 and 2003. <br/><br/>About 38% of Afghanistan’s land area is comprised of ecoregions that are Endangered, 61% as Vulnerable, and only 1% as Stable. The ecoregions at highest threat are in an arc around the country’s mountain chain and are comprised of open and closed woodlands. <br/><br/>Afghanistan’s rapidly increasing human population presents the major challenge to biodiversity conservation and ultimately to the quality of life of Afghans. Despite years of warfare that killed or displaced millions of Afghans, the population has doubled since 1979 to 24.3 - 32.7 million, the latter figure approximates the highest population level for 2008 predicted in 1978 by the World Bank. Currently, Afghanistan’s population growth is among the fastest in the world and the low median age of the Afghans ensures that rapid growth will continue for many years. Afghanistan’s population can be expected to increase to 61 - 79 million people by 2050. <br/>Proximal threats to Afghanistan’s biodiversity are land encroachment, over-hunting, deforestation, over-grazing, shrub collection, dryland farming, water diversion and climate change. All of these threats have worsened in recent years. <br/><br/>The overall conclusion is that despite an expenditure of more than $70 million in recent years, Afghanistan will not be able to meet the CBD’s 2010 target to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss Three circumstances are largely responsible: 1) thirty years of instability has resulted in Afghanistan being amongst the very poorest countries in world. The continuing conflict limits the ability to undertake conservation efforts throughout most of the country; 2) a lack of Governmental implementation of biodiversity policy and programmes at the ground level due to weak administrative and technical capacity and inadequate funding directed to Government. UN institutions and NGOs have stepped in to fill this gap, but by necessity have expended most of their time and resources on developing the conceptual, legal, and policy structure that will provide the foundation for future implementation; 3) the extent of Afghanistan’s biodiversity loss and ecological degradation is so profound and population pressures so pressing that halting the decline and restoring a level of ecological integrity cannot be achieved without simultaneous success in ameliorating poverty. <br/><br/>This project proposes to address a component of these challenges by implementing recommendations in the NPASP by identifying potential protected areas in high priority areas of the country, developing management plans and governance structures for already identified protected areas, and enhancing the management capacity in Afghanistan’s only designated protected area.<br/><br/>There are four project objectives. Local context relevant to each is as follows.<br/>Objective 1. Determine locations of protected areas in priority areas recommended in Afghanistan’s National Protected Area System Plan (NPASP). Gissaro-Alai open woodlands (≥73km²) and Hindu Kush alpine meadow (≥565km²): Priority Zone Area 1 – northeastern Badakhshan. Local context is unknown and surveys are required. This priority zone appears to be a relatively undisturbed area bordering Tajikistan. It is suspected to hold populations of Protected Species such as Snow leopard, Cape hare, Marco Polo sheep and Brown bear.<br/>Paropamisus xeric woodlands (≥1850km²): Priority Zone Area 2 – northern Takhar and northwestern Badakhshan. Local context is unknown but there are local reports of markhor in the area. There is also an important wetland area that may hold relic populations of Bactrian deer. It has also been designated an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International (selected under the criterion of holding significant numbers of a globally-threatened species, or other species of global conservation action). <br/> Badghyz and Karabil semi-desert (≥1079km²): Priority Zone Area 3 – northern Balkh<br/>Local context is unknown. An initial species range analysis showed this area as containing habitat for Protected Species such as the Corsac fox and Goitered gazelle. <br/>Hindu Kush alpine meadow (≥565km²): Priority Zone Area 4 – southern Badakhshan and northern Nuristan. Local Context is unknown. The area is suspected to hold populations of Protected Species such as Snow leopard, Markhor, Asiatic black bear and Musk deer. During the species analysis, this zone was also highlighted as a key area for biome-restricted and globally-threatened bird species and has been designated an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International.  <br/><br/>Objective 2. Little Pamir Proposed Protected Areas. The Little Pamir Proposed Protected Areas are currently grazed by domestic yaks but are otherwise free of extensive human use. This region constitutes a rare example of healthy rangelands in Afghanistan and is important habitat for Brown bear, Marco Polo sheep, snow leopard, ibex, many birds of prey, wolf, Pallas cat, Cape hare, and lynx. These areas are of conservation importance for Afghanistan because they include global 200 ecoregions, contain many threatened and protected species, and are currently not as important for human use as other areas in the Wakhan. Threats to the area include illegal hunting and potential for overgrazing in the future.<br/><br/>Objective 3. Band-e-Amir Protected Area. Band-e-Amir was recently declared Afghanistan’s first National Park. Although management policies are in place for protected areas, the policies are not well understood by the Afghan government and implementation of management activities is limited. The communities surrounding Band-e-Amir also expect the government to share or distribute revenue generated within the protected area. A central goal to the Band-e-Amir management component will be to provide management guidance to local communities and the Government of Afghanistan. This guidance will help establish management practices for Band-e-Amir that will serve as an example for protected area establishment in the future. Threats to be addressed include shrub collection, reed cutting, and livestock grazing as well as hunting. <br/><br/>Objective 4. Ajar Valley and corridor. Ajar Valley was declared a wildlife reserve in 1977. The area includes important protected species such as ibex, urial, snow leopard, common leopard, and the common otter. The corridor linking Band-e-Amir to Ajar Valley will provide an important protected corridor allowing species to move between two protected areas and helping populations recover from years of overhunting. This area is also characterized by sheer-sided canyons and the Ajar River. Establishing protected areas in Ajar Valley and the corridor linking it to Band-e-Amir would facilitate implementation of the proposed National Protected Area System Plan while assisting in community development and governance.",

One of the components of the NCSA was a national biodiversity assessment which identified a system to protect areas of high biodiversity in all major ecoregions. <br/>Afghanistan has an on-going GEF/UNDP Supporting Country Action on the CBD Programme of Work on Protected  Areas Early Action grant. The project envisions four major outcomes two of which entail planning and priority settting. The first of these is a National Protected Area Gap Analysis. The current status of protected area proposals in Afghanistan remains primarily a function of past proposals (dating back to the 1970s) revisited with some additions and changes resulting from recent survey work. However, to date, no systematic gap analysis has been conducted to analyze these proposals and determine their ability to represent and protect Afghanistan’s biological diversity. The gap analysis work will feed directly into the second major outcome – the NPASP, a product required by Article 16 of the draft Protected Areas Regulations and which is designed to identify national and regional protected area targets as well as provide direction for the monitoring and evaluation of the system as a whole. <br/><br/>The Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS) is a MDG-based plan that serves as Afghanistan’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). It is underpinned by the principles, pillars and benchmarks of the Afghanistan Compact. It was released in December 2008 and represents an attempt to comprehensively address the major challenges that face Afghanistan. The ANDS reflects the government’s vision, principles and goals for Afghanistan, which are organized under three pillars: (i) Security; (ii) Governance, Rule of Law and Human Rights; and (iii) Economic and Social Development. Environment falls under the third pillar. The ANDS focuses mainly on the next five years, but it also reflects Afghanistan’s long-term goals. <br/><br/>The ANDS is very large planning compendium comprised of a main document supplemented by 22 sector strategies, 37 institutional strategies, and 35 Provincial strategies as appendices.  One of the sector strategies is the National Environment Strategy which has 6 thematic strategies one of which is “Protected Areas and Biodiversity”.  Among the desired outcomes are a) clarity on the legal status and boundaries of protected areas, b) enabling legislation on establishing and managing protected areas c) hydrological and biodiversity assessment of protected areas and d) clearance of land mines from protected areas.",

		"description": "Zanzibar currently has six government protected areas totaling 11, 960 ha, 828 ha of protected mangroves, and 14,247 ha designated as high protection zones under 36 Community Forest Management Agreements (CoFMA).  Thus, over 10% of Zanzibar’s total land area (245,000 ha) and 4% of its mangroves (20,000 ha) under some form of protection.  These areas are biologically important and economically vital for water catchment, carbon sequestration, traditional medicines and other non-timber forest products, soil fertility, and protection from coastal erosion (which is predicted to increase dramatically with climate change).  In addition, ecotourism is growing in Jozani-Chwaka Bay National Park (JCBNP), Kiwengwa-Pongwe Forest Reserve (KPFW) and Ngezi-Vumawimbi Nature Forest Reserve. Revenue sharing schemes are in place to ensure that revenues are both recycled back into the PAs for management purposes and shared with local communities.   <br/><br/>The main threats to these PAs and Zanzibar’s biodiversity are forest destruction and degradation due to cutting for firewood, charcoal production and building poles, and agricultural encroachment.  With its very high human population density (400 individuals/km2) which is increasing at an estimated rate of 3.1% per year, Zanzibar is currently losing approximately 1,000 ha (or 1.2%) of its remaining natural vegetation annually (DCCFF 2008).  Concomitant with forest loss is depletion in faunal biodiversity; for example, the Aders’ duiker population declined an estimated 88% in the 17 years between 1983 and 1999 (Swai 1983, Williams et al. 1996, Kanga 1999). Similarly, there have been sharp decreases in endemic bird populations such as Fischer’s Turaco, the Brown-Headed Parrot and the Pemba Owl.  Although some government and community managed forests have been established, they are ineffectively managed due to modest resources and low human capacity. They are increasingly threatened by fragmentation and isolation by a human population with limited alternative livelihood options.  <br/><br/>Our goal for Zanzibar is the persistence of viable populations of all of Zanzibar endangered endemics in a cohesive and well-managed network of government and community protected areas. These will be linked by functional habitat corridors and supported by local communities that benefit economically, environmentally and culturally from the conservation of their natural heritage.  To realize this goal we propose to implement effective management across a network of government and community managed PAs, expand the number of PAs to include all remaining forest patches that are important for the continued survival of Zanzibar’s natural heritage, restore connectivity among the PAs, build the capacity of communities and the forestry sector to manage PAs, explore sustainable financing mechanisms, and build public understanding of and support for PAs.",

Moreover, this hotspot ranks highest in the world for its density of endemic plants and vertebrates (Myers et al. 2000).  Biogeographically, Zanzibar’s flora belongs to the Zanzibar-Inhambane regional centre of endemism (UNEP, 2001), which extends from Somalia to Mozambique.  The forests of Unguja and Pemba, the main two islands of Zanzibar, are ranked as top priority landscapes in the Eastern Africa Coastal Forests Ecoregion.  Having separated from mainland Africa at least 15,000 years ago, these forests harbor a unique flora and fauna which is both locally and globally important.  At least 17 endemic plant and 6 endemic vertebrate species (including two of Africa’s most endangered mammals, the Zanzibar Red Colobus and Aders’ duiker) are found in these forests.  Despite being severely threatened by a rapidly growing human population, Zanzibar’s forests still maintain most of their original faunal assemblages. If we act quickly there is still time to conserve these forests in a comprehensive network of government and community protected areas linked by functional corridors (see attached map of proposed PA network for Unguja; the Pemba PA network is yet to be designed).  In addition to being unique from mainland Tanzania ecologically, Zanzibar has its own government, legislature and strategic planning processes, thus in terms of conservation complementarity, the conservation of its resources is even more important.",

This area features a rough topography with more than 200 rivers and streams whose soil shows unstable geological conditions. In addition, the occupation of flood-prone areas, the construction of housing on steep hills, changes experienced in water regimes, the occupation of overall unstable areas, the blocking of slopes and the disposal of debris and dumping of wastes in canals represent major risk factors in terms of social construction. This also increases the existing level of vulnerability to potential disasters in the city, which is located at 3.600 meters over sea level.<br/>The Municipality of La Paz posses a great variety of biodiversity, landscapes and ecosystems, which due to the unplanned increase of the urban areas was destroyed and devastated in many ways. One of them is the expansion of the urban area over the rural one. In response as this phenomenon the Municipality of La Paz established recently the Municipal Protected Areas System (MPAS) in 2008, under the leadership of Dr. Juan del Granado Cosio current mayor of the La Paz Municipality.<br/><br/>The MPAS was constituted with the main goal of seeking governance models that strengthen the conservation of the biodiversity and environmental services that a variety of ecosystems provide, through the development of economic and social incentives that allow to local inhabitants to contribute in the sustainable management of the lands and take part in the efforts of the National conservation.<br/><br/>The project will strengthen the sustainable management of this innovative System of Protected Areas through i) strength and consolidate the institutional management of the System, ii) protect the hydrological fresh water sources in the main protected areas (such as Zongo and Hampaturi), and iii) design and implement financial mechanisms for the integral management of the biodiversity in the whole protected areas.",

		"ecological_contribution": "The Municipality of La Paz it’s about 2,012 square kilometres and is divided into 23 districts, which are grouped in 8 macro-districts (seven are located in urban and almost urban areas and one of them is completely rural), its management is delegated in sub-municipalities. <br/><br/>One of the most important areas for the biodiversity that provides vital environmental goods and services to La Paz Municipality is the tropical region of about 2900 -3000 meters of the low lands belonging to Zongo Valley, the other one is about 5000 meters wide of the highest mountains. However, the low lands belong to Zongo Valley, that posses totally different ecological characteristics to the rest of the municipal area. Such characteristics of relative humidity and precipitations provide fresh water in approximately 90% to the whole municipal area, the remaining area of the municipality has a dry climate.<br/><br/>In the low lands (Río Abajo) humidity is relative in magnitude, precipitations are about 600 mm as in La Paz city, but higher temperatures allow a greater hydrological shortage. There is a rain stationary, occurring principally in the summer, meanwhile the winters are very dry (these characteristics are presented in most tropical climates). The author Montes de Oca 1989, reports the climate values of La Paz urban area with a mean value of 11.2 ºC. <br/><br/>From a thermic point of view, the average difference of warm and cold months is hardly 4.3ºC which shows the importance of humid tropical areas conservation. However, it is interesting to evaluate the maximum and minimum temperatures that are considered the most important elements for biota survival. The climate change phenomenon increases maximum temperatures, and then to preserve humid areas is very important for elements such as flora, which needs to survive in their own climate conditions.<br/><br/>The higher temperature in the municipality is about 22.5 ºC and the minimum is about -1,3 ºC, these numbers represent a big gap for a dry climate. In the arid regions of the municipality (Mallasa, Lipari) the difference between months is greater than that, due to the increase in the dryness that causes this contrast. Due to sun impacts during the day over the north mountainside of the South Hemisphere most of the areas located in the Municipality of La Paz are very dry almost all year long; in counterpart Zongo Valley’s weather is always humid therefore the thermic conditions are almost invariable.<br/><br/>Another important protected area of the Municipality of La Paz is Hampaturi, located close to the urban places. As Zongo, Hampaturi represents also a vital source of water, biodiversity, landscapes and other environmental services. Actually the area is getting crowded and many incentives are required for its sustainable development regarding its biodiversity conservation.<br/><br/>La Paz city is located in a excavated basin in the Altiplano surface, geologically it is a rich region where is possible to observe and study phenomena of sedimentation and erosion, mud formations, alluvial cones, and also volcanic phenomena formed in the past, but recently it is particularly interesting to observe the glacier retreatment in the Andean Zone. La Paz lands are divided into three categories: 1) superficial lands belonging to contemporary places of erosions, 2) lands of sedimentary formation belonging to the Altiplano, and 3) old lands that constitute the baseboard of the other lands.",

					"description": "The city of La Paz is the administrative capital and the second most populated city in Bolivia. The urban area of La Paz has developed in a narrow valley of La Paz River. This area features a rough topography with more than 200 rivers and streams whose soil shows unstable geological conditions. In addition, the occupation of flood-prone areas, the construction of housing on steep hills, changes experienced in water regimes, the occupation of overall unstable areas, the blocking of slopes and the disposal of debris and dumping of wastes in canals represent major risk factors in terms of social construction. This also increases the existing level of vulnerability to potential disasters in the city, which is located at 3.600 meters over sea level.<br/>The Municipality of La Paz posses a great variety of biodiversity, landscapes and ecosystems, which due to the unplanned increase of the urban areas was destroyed and devastated in many ways. One of them is the expansion of the urban area over the rural one. In response as this phenomenon the Municipality of La Paz established recently the Municipal Protected Areas System (MPAS) in 2008, under the leadership of Dr. Juan del Granado Cosio current mayor of the La Paz Municipality.<br/><br/>The MPAS was constituted with the main goal of seeking governance models that strengthen the conservation of the biodiversity and environmental services that a variety of ecosystems provide, through the development of economic and social incentives that allow to local inhabitants to contribute in the sustainable management of the lands and take part in the efforts of the National conservation.<br/><br/>The project will strengthen the sustainable management of this innovative System of Protected Areas through i) strength and consolidate the institutional management of the System, ii) protect the hydrological fresh water sources in the main protected areas (such as Zongo and Hampaturi), and iii) design and implement financial mechanisms for the integral management of the biodiversity in the whole protected areas.",

		"summary": "A coalition of Government, NGOs, and civil society organizations have come together to discuss the need to develop a mechanism for long-term financing of Uganda’s protected areas.  The group has recommended the creation of the Uganda Conservation Trust Fund (UCTF) that is independent of Government and which can generate the financial resources necessary to support the management of protected areas in Uganda.",
		"description": "Since 1996, when the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) was established, the management of the parks and reserves has significantly improved with contributions from donors in the form of technical and financial services.  Animal numbers are increasing steadily, particularly those species that were heavily poached in the late 1970s. Elephant numbers in Queen Elizabeth Park have recovered to their 1960s levels when they were at their highest. However, poaching remains a problem and as the animal numbers rise so does the illegal hunting. Conflicts between the animals and local people are also increasing as a result of rising animal numbers and greater demand for land. UWA needs to work with local communities to find adequate solutions to the conflicts while helping to improve local livelihoods. <br/><br/>UWA has begun to improve its revenue generating capability. Increased tourism investment and demand has raised tourism to the number one foreign exchange earner, resulting in higher levels of income that allow UWA to cover a greater portion of its operating expenses. Despite these advances, UWA is still not financially sustainable. About 75% of current operating costs are covered from gate receipts and concessions, however, current expenditures fall below the optimum required to achieve conservation success in accordance with the spending plans developed as part of the organization’s business plan. There is a need to ensure that past investment in the parks and reserves is not lost and that UWA has sufficient financial resources to continue to effectively manage the country’s protected areas. <br/><br/>The tourism market is fickle and can drop very quickly if there are any signs of insecurity or political instability both globally and nationally. There is a need for diverse sources of financial support that provide financial stability. The proposed UCTF would address this need by creating a financial source separate from UWA, but dedicated entirely to ensuring the financing of the protection of Uganda’s biodiversity.<br/><br/>The design of an independent trust fund that will help mobilize funds and provide financing for the entire protected area network follows effective models developed in other countries.  For example, Madagascar has recently established a trust fund to support the financing of the country’s PA system and trust funds such as PROFONANPE and the Bhutan Trust have for years directed their funding on a PA system wide basis, working in close collaboration with government agencies.  More than 50 independent trust funds (with boards independent of government but with government representation) currently operate to finance biodiversity conservation.  WCS has been involved in helping establish a variety of these, including the recently established Tri-National Sangha Fund (Cameroon, CAR and Congo) to finance protected area management in the tri-country region. These conservation funds finance strategic gaps and help PA managers invest and deliver better conservation outcomes.  Donors, private sector, and civil society prefer the accountability and transparency of these independent trusts, which allows them to attract funds and develop innovative financing schemes.",

The group has recommended the creation of the Uganda Conservation Trust Fund (UCTF) that is independent of Government and which can generate the financial resources necessary to support the management of protected areas in Uganda. <br/><br/>The UCTF will support all National Parks, Wildlife Reserves and Community Wildlife Areas in Uganda. Places that are of particular conservation value both nationally and globally include Rwenzori Mountains National Park (a World Heritage Site), Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Queen Elizabeth National Park, Kibale National Park, Semliki National Park, Murchison Falls National Park, Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, and Kidepo Valley National Park. Most are located within the Albertine Rift region, which contains some of the greatest levels of biodiversity in all of Africa, including more endemic and threatened vertebrates than any other region on the continent. <br/><br/>Uganda is a country of exceptional diversity, encompassing a zone of overlap between the savannas of East Africa and the West African rain forests. Uganda’s geographic features range from glacier-topped mountains, rain forests, and dry deciduous acacia bushland to wetlands and swamps.  <br/><br/>As part of an ecological gap analysis, Uganda’s Forest Department confirmed the extent of the biodiversity throughout its forests in the mid 1990s, and published the findings in the Uganda Forestry Nature Conservation Masterplan. The surveys sampled trees, butterflies, birds, mammals and moths and listed the number of species unique to these forests: Bwindi (27); Rwenzori (20); Semliki (81); Kibale (7); Mt Elgon (28).  As a result, the Government upgraded the forest reserves to national parks and placed their management under Uganda National Parks (today’s Uganda Wildlife Authority).  <br/><br/>No ecological gap analysis has been undertaken of savanna woodland and grassland habitats but it is known that both Queen Elizabeth and Murchison Falls Parks in the Albertine Rift, together with Kidepo Valley Park in the north east, have a high level of biodiversity as compared with other savanna regions in Africa. Queen Elizabeth is particularly rich and ranks second after Virunga Park (across border in DR Congo) for its bird species richness (624 species identified) in Africa. Nationally, the parks and wildlife reserves 'capture' much of the biodiversity in the country because they cover most of the ecological zones/habitats. Many of the protected areas are connected to others in larger landscapes. Uganda is working to manage conservation within the Greater Virunga Landscape and across the Albertine Rift under a common strategy shared with DR Congo and Rwanda. Similarly, transboundary initiatives are in place for several landscapes in Northern Uganda bordering Sudan.",

Effective management of protected areas demands equitable sharing of costs and benefits with local communities. The business plans developed by UWA identify community-level investments that can ultimately benefit long-term conservation objectives. Specifically, the Trust Fund will support a diverse set of activities benefiting communities, such as:<br/><br/>- Improving management of existing Community Wildlife Areas<br/>- Promoting and co-financing of community-owned tourism enterprises<br/>- Addressing human-wildlife conflict (such as promoting animal-friendly agricultural practices, land use planning, alternative livelihoods)<br/>- Addressing human-wildlife disease issues, such as prevention, vaccinations, and disease treatment, monitoring<br/>- Promoting sustainable use of natural resources through better use and planning",

		"financial_sustainability": "1. Counterpart funding and institutional commitment:<br/>The creation of the UCTF is spearheaded by the UWA with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) playing key advisory role in the process. Both of these institutions have committed financial resources to fund UCTF start up expenses. A total of about $95,500 has been allocated for this project ($33,000 from UWA and $62,500 from WCS). Other entities (such as Uganda Investment Authority, Uganda Tourism Board, Bwindi Trust, Ecotrust and others) are being consulted or will become members of the Steering Committee to ensure broad stakeholder support.<br/><br/>2. Sustainable financing mechanism<br/>The UCTF will operate under a prudent financing scheme ensuring its long-term sustainability. While the initial management and administration costs will be funded by grants (such as LifeWeb), in the long term these expenses will be paid from the income generated by the Trust Fund’s return on investment, and the development of income generating activities that will allow resources to flow into the UCTF’s accounts and be managed for specific and targeted conservation activities. <br/><br/>Capitalization of the Trust Fund through donor outreach will be the UCTF’s major objective, so that it can generate the conservation funds needed from its investment income.  The income to UCTF will come not only from the investment of donor funds (both from public and private sources) but also through various entrepreneurial conservation finance mechanisms linked to Uganda's protected areas. Currently, UWA in collaboration with WCS is undertaking extensive business planning activity for its protected areas, which would assess these revenue-generating opportunities for each protected area. <br/><br/>Some examples and priorities are:<br/>- Additional user fees or taxes, that are earmarked for conservation of protected areas.<br/>- Conservation concessions which allow for a concessionaire to co-manage a designated protected area or a part of it.<br/>- Carbon finance projects that generate income from sales of credits to protect or rehabilitate forests in/around Uganda protected areas.<br/>- Biodiversity offset projects (e.g. oil industry in Uganda) whereby business pays to compensate for the impact on biodiversity, channeling those payments through the trust fund. <br/>- Biodiversity enterprises in or around protected areas (e.g., ecotourism).<br/>- Payments for ecosystem services, such as income from protecting watershed services, climate control and agricultural services. <br/>- Other options, such as biodiversity prospecting and debt-for-nature swaps will also be explored. <br/><br/>The UCTF structure will allow for flexibility to assure that the administration and management costs are transparent, optimal, and efficient so that UCTF realizes its mission with low administrative costs. For example, a donor may be willing to capitalize a separate endowment sub-account for the specific purpose of covering 100% of the Trust Fund's administrative and overhead costs, which would enable the Trust Fund to attract more donations by guaranteeing to future potential donors that none of their donations to the fund would be used to pay for its administrative costs. Sub-accounts may be set up to cover the costs in perpetuity for a specific protected area, allowing UWA to focus its resources on other areas.",
		"funding_info": "",
		"alignment": "The initiative to establish and operate UCTF fits into various national planning strategies and links with priorities identified through other national sustainable development planning processes.<br/><br/>1. Uganda and CBD Programme of Work on Protected Areas (PoWPA): <br/>Aware of its commitment towards meeting the 2010 global target of significantly reducing the current rate of biodiversity loss, the government of Uganda has set aside 732 protected areas covering 32,067 km2 or 16.3% of the total land area. The National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan consolidates the initiatives taken this far and focuses future actions on the realization of the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity. <br/><br/>Uganda has submitted two proposals for the CBD Programme of Work on Protected Areas (PoWPA); these focus on assessing protected area governance (Activity 1.1.4) in Phase I, and on assessing protected area values (Activity 3.1.2) in Phase II. The consensus from the stakeholder consultations was that two issues stand out as the  most important – the need to promote the most suitable PA conservation approaches and corresponding governance types as well as valuation of the contribution of PA resources to national socio-economic development. Funding for the former was sought and has recently been approved by UNDP-GEF PoWPA Country Action Grants Programme (Phase I). The stakeholders who participated in the national workshop felt that, in order not to lose focus, the socio-economic valuation of the PA resources to national socio-economic development needed to be treated as a separate project with additional funding, which is the focus of Phase II. Hence, the LifeWeb proposal fills an important role in focusing on Sustainable Financing Mechanisms. <br/><br/>2. Uganda's other national planning and conservation context:<br/>Uganda has made great efforts to address biodiversity loss and ensure an effective national system of protected areas and natural resource management, for example through the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP), Wildlife Protected Area System Plan, the National Forest Plan, the Wetlands Sector Strategic Plan and Forestry Nature Conservation Master Plan. These plans provide a framework to guide the setting of conservation priorities, channeling of investments and building of the necessary capacity for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in the country.",

		"description": "There are two broadly defined threats to the biodiversity of all of Bolikhamxay Province – hunting and habitat loss and modification.  Hunting threatens nearly all taxa of animals; species with larger body sizes are under particular threat.  Both local residents and outsiders hunt.  Some local residents are dependent on wildlife to fulfill a portion of their protein needs. This is particularly true of the rural residents of Bolikhamxay, who comprise 80% of the population. WCS works with these communities to harvest wildlife and NTFP sustainably. Other local residents hunt wildlife to sell to both national and international traders.  Southern China and Vietnam have a long tradition of consuming wildlife as a luxury item; the growing middle class of these countries has lead to a dramatic surge in the demand for wildlife.  WCS works with the Government of Lao PDR to stop this trade.<br/><br/>Habitat loss in Bolikhamxay Province impacts lands both inside and outside of protected areas due primarily to three causes: 1) degradation that began in the late 1980’s with the overharvest of economically valuable eagelaria, a resin used for perfume, which shifted to rose wood in the early 2000’s.  Small bands of loggers enter the forest, live off the land (including hunting wildlife) and harvest these valuable trees.  Habitat loss and degradation have been greatest in Bolikhamxay’s Provincial Protected Areas due to little or no on-the-ground law enforcement; 2) confusion over the boundaries of all the protected areas, which contributes to encroachment; and 3) landscapes surrounding protected areas have seen rapid forest eucalyptus and rubber plantation establishment, particularly over the past five years.  The majority of these plantations have been established on degraded land that was logged in the 1980’s.  Most of the plantation establishment is done by reputable companies, however this is not always the case with some plantations failing as soon as the “salvage” logging is completed. Amongst their many negative impacts, the less-reputable companies encourage local people to “poach” logs and wildlife within protected areas of Bolikhamxay Province. <br/><br/>An underlying indirect threat that contributes to all aspects of biodiversity loss in Laos is the low technical capacity of protected area staff and lack of resources to do the needed work.  Laos is still recovering from decades of conflict and consequently the education system in the country is still well below international standards. Over the past six years the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) has addressed this issue in its approach to conservation of Bolikhamxay Province by providing formal training to all provincial staff on Protected Area management.  The Integrated Ecosystem and Wildlife Management Project (IEWMP), established through a formal MoU between WCS and the Government of Laos, defines this partnership. This project is now in its eight year. All the objectives and results delineated in this proposal to LifeWeb will be achieved through the IEWMP; therefore the majority of the activities will be implemented by Government of Lao PDR staff.",

		"ecological_contribution": "The biodiversity of Bolikhamxay Province is of both global and national importance.  Roughly speaking the province can be divided into two ecological areas – east and west.  <br/>The Annamite Mountains that run along the eastern half of the province are blanketed by a unique evergreen wet forest that is home to a high number of endemic species. This distinct habitat is found only along the Annamite Mountains of Laos and Vietnam. Much of this forest remains sparsely explored, and many large mammal species have been discovered there in recent years, such as the Saola, the Large Antlered Muntjac and the Annamite Striped Rabbit. Most of the endemic wildlife is under severe threat.  This habitat type and its associated wildlife are found in its largest contiguous area in Bolikhamxay Province; the great majority of this is officially part of the Nam Chouan Protection Forest, the Nam Chat/Nam Pan Watershed Protection Forest, the Phou Chom Voy Provincial Protected Area, the Phou Sithone Endangered Species Conservation Area, and the Nam Theun Extension Biodiversity Conservation Area.  However, none of these conservation and protection forests have adequate on-the ground protection and management. Three of these protected areas, the Phou Chom Voy Provincial Protected Area, the Phou Sithone Endangered Species Conservation Area, and the Nam Theun Extension Biodiversity Conservation Area are the focus of this proposal to LifeWeb.<br/><br/>In addition to unique endemics, these forests of eastern Bolikhamxay are also home to several endangered primates including gibbons, douc langurs and leaf monkeys.  While we do know that gibbons, doucs and leaf monkeys are present, this area has been little explored biologically so it is therefore uncertain where these species will fall within the IUCN Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered categories. <br/><br/>Due to their uniqueness, these evergreen forests of eastern Bolikhamxay Province are globally irreplaceable and an ecological priority for the Laos national protected area system. Due to their size and contiguity, they hold the best chance for the long-term viability of its endemic wildlife.  They are connected through thin corridors to smaller patches of this forest type further south and to the mixed forest types of western Bolikhamxay through a variety of corridors, some of which are in good shape and others which are highly degraded.  None of these corridors to the west are currently under protection. Partnering with the government of Lao PDR, WCS is currently engaged with a private sector partner in the Nam Gnouang South Protection Forest.  This location plays an important strategic corridor role in eastern Bolikhamxay linking three conservation forests including Phou Chom Voy PPA, Phou Sithone ESCA, and Nam Kading National Protected Area.  The expansion and integration of activities throughout this forest complex in eastern Bolikhamxay is the second focus of this proposal to LifeWeb. <br/><br/>The mixed semi-tropical forests of western Bolikhamxay are largely of a type that was historically found fairly widely in Indochina with species such as elephant and clouded leopard.  Much of this habitat has been converted for agriculture, logging and plantations. However, several protected areas, the Nam Kading National Protected Area in particular, have largely escaped this conversion and thus are of national and regional importance.  The Nam Kading National Protected Area is over 1,600 square kilometers, and can likely support viable populations of many medium sized mammals including at least four Critically Endangered and Endangered primate species. These include the Northern White-cheeked Gibbon, the Southern White-cheeked Gibbon, Red-shanked Douc Langur and one or possibly two Leaf-monkey species in the taxonomically unclear (but clearly highly threatened) Trachypithecus complex.  The Nam Kading National Protected Area is not a focus of this proposal to LifeWeb, however it will benefit from the proposed work described here.",

These forests, however, are subject to numerous drivers of deforestation and forest degradation: habitat conversion for swidden agriculture and plantations in the buffer zone areas, illegal logging and illegal encroachment inside protected areas. In this regard, the project will protect forest carbon through working with local stakeholders on land-use management and law enforcement efforts to tackle these drivers of forest loss. In addition, the project will investigate reforestation and regeneration opportunities on lands that have previously been deforested, where appropriate."

Costs include the changed nature of access to natural resources in the Protected Areas by local communities, which the IEWMP will strive to ensure is managed fairly. The IEWMP will continue to ensure that benefits are shared equitably, for example, by continuing to create fish harvesting zones that are accessible to all villagers.  At a larger scale, WCS will draw upon our experience in Cambodia and Madagascar to design mechanisms of equitable distribution of REDD+ revenues should these materialize.",

In 2013-2015, the Theun-Hinboun Power Company, who is planning construction of a second dam in the province, will contribute approximately $200,000 to strengthening provincial protected area management.  Bolikhamxay Province and the northern Annamite Mountains is a long-term priority for the WCS, and thus WCS will continue to provide resources towards their conservation through funding of senior managerial and technical staff.  WCS has also raised $200,000 from the Save Our Species Fund for 2013-2014, primarily focused on the management of the Phou Sithone Endangered Species Conservation Area.  WCS is committed to raising additional funds for the conservation of this area.  In the past WCS has received funds for IEWMP work from the Global Environment Facility, the Critical Ecosystems Partnership Fund and the US Fish and Wildlife Service.  <br/><br/>Sustainable Financing Mechanisms<br/>WCS and the Government of Laos have developed several pilot sustainable financing projects in Bolikhamxay Province. These include village level fish conservation zones (no-take zones along several rivers that act as source sites for sustainable fishing in other regions of the river), sustainable harvest of certain non-timber forest products which are then sold at increased prices through provincial government sponsors, and village level rice banks.  These projects are still in early stages and thus they may be significantly altered as the Integrated Ecosystem and Wildlife Management Project (IEWMP, the formal entity under which WCS works with the Government of Laos in Bolikhamxay Province) discovers what works best, but it is this category of activity that WCS and the Government of Laos would pursue in eastern Bolikhamxay with funding from LifeWeb.   <br/><br/>WCS and the Government of Laos are also currently exploring several other approaches to sustainable financing of protected areas in Bolikhamxay.  WCS is also exploring ecotourism in Bolikhamxay Province, particularly as tourism in general is a growing industry in Laos.  However at its maximum ecotourism will likely generate only a relatively small amount of the overall revenue needed to sustain the protected areas and contribute to local economies.  WCS is also currently developing models of sustained financing mechanisms with private industry in Lao PDR.  Specifically in Bolikhamxay WCS is engaged with the hydropower sector to develop conservation and natural resources management initiatives funded by revenues from power production.<br/><br/>There is also scope for lands in the province to benefit from REDD+ based funding. Laos is a recipient of both Forest Carbon Partnership Facility  (FCPF) and Forest Investment Program (FIP) funds as well as donor funds to support Laos during its REDD Readiness stage. This includes funds for establishing the necessary institutions, frameworks and strategies at the national level, but also to implement field based activities that reduce the impact of drivers of forest loss locally. Currently, WCS is supporting the government of Laos to establish a jurisdictional based REDD+ project in Houaphan province from which we expect to transfer lessons learned to Bolikhamxay province for the benefit of PAs.",

These three areas are: 1) Sustainable financing; 2) Capacity development; and, 3) improved governance.  The activities described in this proposal address each of these core areas.  Furthermore the activities of the IEWMP in Bolikhamxay are held as a national model for protected area management (as demonstrated by the use of the Nam Kading NPA Management Plan as model for other National Protected Areas) in the country and thus advances made with funds from LifeWeb will impact protected areas at a national level. <br/><br/>The activities in this proposal will help the GoL meet objectives for Protected Area management set forth in the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action plan (2004) , National Forestry Strategy to 2020 (2005)  and National Growth and Poverty Elevation Plan (2004) .

		"description": "There are two broadly defined threats to the biodiversity of Bolikhamxay Province, including the Nam Kading National Protected Area – hunting and habitat loss.  Hunting threatens nearly all taxa of animals; species with larger body sizes are under particular threat.  Both local residents and outsiders hunt.  Some local residents are dependent on wildlife to fulfill a portion of their protein needs. This is particularly true of the rural residents of Bolikhamxay, who comprise 80% of the population. WCS works with these communities to harvest wildlife and non-timber forest products sustainably.  Other local residents hunt wildlife to sell to both national and international traders.  Southern China and Vietnam have a long- tradition of consuming wildlife as a luxury item; the growing middle class of these countries has lead to a dramatic surge in the demand for wildlife from all of Laos, including the wildlife of the Nam Kading National Protected Area.  WCS works with the Government of Lao PDR to stop this trade.<br/><br/>Habitat loss in Bolikhamxay Province impacts lands both inside and outside of protected areas, due primarily to three causes: 1) degradation that began in the late 1980’s with the overharvest of economically valuable eagelaria, a resin used for perfume, which shifted to rose wood in the early 2000’s.  Small bands of loggers enter the forest, live off the land (including hunting wildlife) and harvest these valuable trees.  Habitat loss and degradation have been greatest in Bolikhamxay’s Provincial Protected Areas due to little or no on-the-ground law enforcement; 2) confusion over the boundaries of all the protected areas, which contributes to encroachment; and 3) landscapes surrounding protected areas have seen rapid forest eucalyptus and rubber plantation establishment, particularly over the past five years.  The majority of these plantations have been established on degraded land that was logged in the 1980’s.  Most of the plantation establishment is done by reputable companies, however this is not always the case with some plantations failing as soon as the “salvage” logging is completed. Amongst their many negative impacts, the less-reputable companies encourage local people to “poach” logs within protected areas of Bolikhamxay Province. <br/><br/>An underlying indirect threat that contributes to all aspects of biodiversity loss in Laos is the low technical capacity of protected area staff and lack of resources to do the needed work.  Laos is still recovering from decades of conflict and consequently the education system in the country is still well below international standards. Over the past six years the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) has addressed this issue in its approach to conservation of Bolikhamxay Province by providing formal training to all provincial staff on Protected Area management.  The Integrated Ecosystem and Wildlife Management Project (IEWMP), established through a formal MoU between WCS and the Government of Laos, defines this partnership. This partnership has successfully implemented a series of interventions to address the threats, and the reduced levels of wildlife and forest loss suggest that these approaches are effective and should continue to be pursued with vigor. All the objectives and results delineated in this proposal to LifeWeb will be achieved through the IEWMP, which means the majority of the activities will be implemented by Government of Laos PDR staff.",

The Pha Kaounchan Provincial Protected Area is a massive, isolated limestone karst outcropping.  The limestone karsts of central Laos have only in the past few years begun to be biologically explored and what has been found so far has been extraordinary, including a new species of mammal so distinct that it is a new family - the first new family of mammals described anywhere in over a century. In addition, a distinct new species of bird in this limestone karst was also discovered in 2008. Further, these limestone karsts are home to primates in the taxonomically complex Trachypithecus genus, all of which are highly threatened. The Pha Kaounchan is one of these limestone karsts and it has essentially never been biologically surveyed.<br/><br/>The Phou Long Provincial Protected Area contains some of the few remaining lowland mixed semi-tropical forests of Indochina.  It is also a central part of an essentially linear series of forests that are home to one of Indochina’s largest Asian elephant meta-populations.  This Asian elephant meta-population runs from the Phou Khao Khoay Protected Area of Xaisomboun Province in the northwest linearly through Phou Long then Nam Kading then the base of Pha Kaounchan protected areas of Bolikhamxay Province and terminating in the Nakai Plateau of Khammoun Province in the southeast.  <br/><br/>Say Phou Ngou Provincial Protected Area is a long and skinny sandstone hill (Say Phou Ngou means “snake-like mountain” in Lao language) that is the first geologic uprising east of the Mekong. Like much of central Laos it is essentially unsurveyed, but it is likely that it contains potentially important remnant populations of lowland forest wildlife that historically was widespread in Indochina, but which now is under severe threat.",

		"summary": "In addition to unique endemics, these forests of eastern Bolikhamxay are also home to several endangered primates including gibbons, douc langurs and leaf monkeys.  While we do know that gibbons, doucs and leaf monkeys are present, this area has been little explored biologically so it is therefore uncertain where these species will fall within the IUCN Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered categories.",
		"description": "There are two broadly defined threats to the biodiversity of all of Bolikhamxay Province – hunting and habitat loss.  Hunting threatens nearly all taxa of animals; species with larger body sizes are under particular threat.  Both local residents and outsiders hunt.  Some local residents are dependent on wildlife to fulfill a portion of their protein needs. This is particularly true of the rural residents of Bolikhamxay, who comprise 80% of the population. WCS works with these communities to harvest wildlife and NTFP sustainably. Other local residents hunt wildlife to sell to both national and international traders.  Southern China and Vietnam have a long tradition of consuming wildlife as a luxury item; the growing middle class of these countries has lead to a dramatic surge in the demand for wildlife.  WCS works with the Government of Lao PDR to stop this trade.<br/><br/>Habitat loss in Bolikhamxay Province impacts lands both inside and outside of protected areas due primarily to three causes: 1) degradation that began in the late 1980’s with the overharvest of economically valuable eagelaria, a resin used for perfume, which shifted to rose wood in the early 2000’s.  Small bands of loggers enter the forest, live off the land (including hunting wildlife) and harvest these valuable trees.  Habitat loss and degradation have been greatest in Bolikhamxay’s Provincial Protected Areas due to little or no on-the-ground law enforcement; 2) confusion over the boundaries of all the protected areas, which contributes to encroachment; and 3) landscapes surrounding protected areas have seen rapid forest eucalyptus and rubber plantation establishment, particularly over the past five years.  The majority of these plantations have been established on degraded land that was logged in the 1980’s.  Most of the plantation establishment is done by reputable companies, however this is not always the case with some plantations failing as soon as the “salvage” logging is completed. Amongst their many negative impacts, the less-reputable companies encourage local people to “poach” logs within protected areas of Bolikhamxay Province. <br/><br/>An underlying indirect threat that contributes to all aspects of biodiversity loss in Laos is the low technical capacity of protected area staff and lack of resources to do the needed work.  Laos is still recovering from decades of conflict and consequently the education system in the country is still well below international standards. Over the past six years the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) has addressed this issue in its approach to conservation of Bolikhamxay Province by providing formal training to all provincial staff on Protected Area management.  The Integrated Ecosystem and Wildlife Management Project (IEWMP), established through a formal MoU between WCS and the Government of Laos, defines this partnership. All the objectives and results delineated in this proposal to LifeWeb will be achieved through the IEWMP; therefore the majority of the activities will be implemented by Government of Laos PDR staff.",

		"ecological_contribution": "The biodiversity of Bolikhamxay Province is of both global and national importance.  Roughly speaking the province can be divided into two ecological areas – east and west.  <br/>The Annamite Mountains that run along the eastern half of the province are blanketed by a unique evergreen wet forest that is home to a high number of endemic species. This distinct habitat is found only along the Annamite Mountains of Laos and Vietnam. Much of this forest remains sparsely explored, and many large mammal species have been discovered there in recent years, such as the Saola, the Large Antlered Muntjac and the Annamite Striped Rabbit. Most of the endemic wildlife is under severe threat.  This habitat type and its associated wildlife are found in its largest contiguous area in Bolikhamxay Province; the great majority of this is officially part of the Nam Chouan Watershed Protected Area, the Nam Chat/Nam Pan Watershed Protected Area, the Phouchomvoy Provincial Protected Area and the Nam Theun Extension Biodiversity Conservation Area.  However, none of these protected areas have adequate on-the ground protection and management. Two of these protected areas, the Phouchomvoy Provincial Protected Area, and the Nam Theun Extension Biodiversity Conservation Area are the first focus of this proposal to LifeWeb.<br/><br/>In addition to unique endemics, these forests of eastern Bolikhamxay are also home to several endangered primates including gibbons, douc langurs and leaf monkeys.  While we do know that gibbons, doucs and leaf monkeys are present, this area has been little explored biologically so it is therefore uncertain where these species will fall within the IUCN Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered categories. <br/><br/>Due to their uniqueness, these evergreen forests of eastern Bolikhamxay Province are globally irreplaceable and an ecological priority for the Laos national protected area system. Due to their size and contiguity, they hold the best chance for the long-term viability of its endemic wildlife.  They are connected through thin corridors to smaller patches of this forest type further south and to the mixed forest types of western Bolikhamxay through a variety of corridors, some of which are in good shape and others which are highly degraded.  None of these corridors to the west are currently under protection.  The creation of a protected area of approximately 500 square kilometers through one of these corridors is the second focus of this proposal to LifeWeb. <br/><br/>The mixed semi-tropical forests of western Bolikhamxay are largely of a type that was historically found fairly widely in Indochina with species such as elephant and clouded leopard.  Much of this habitat has been converted for agriculture, logging and plantations. However, several protected areas, the Nam Kading in particular, have largely escaped this conversion and thus are of national and regional importance.  The Nam Kading National Protected Area is over 1,600 square kilometers, and can likely support viable populations of many medium sized mammals including at least four Critically Endangered and Endangered primate species. These include the Northern White-cheeked Gibbon, the Southern White-cheeked Gibbon, Red-shanked Douc Langur and one or possibly two Leaf-monkey species in the taxonomically unclear (but clearly highly threatened) Trachypithecus complex.  The Nam Kading National Protected Area is not a focus of this proposal to LifeWeb, however it will benefit from the proposed work described here due to the creation of a protected area to the east which will act as a corridor to the eastern Annamites (see orange polygon on map).",

Costs include the changed nature of access to natural resources in the Protected Areas by local communities, which the IEWMP will strive to ensure is managed fairly. The IEWMP will continue to ensure that benefits are shared equitably, for example, by continuing to create fish harvesting zones that are accessible to all villagers.

		"financial_sustainability": "Counterpart funding and Institutional Commitment<br/>The Government of Laos contributes to this effort primarily through paying the salaries of approximately 40 staff.  In 2010-2011, the Theun-Hinboun Power Company, who is planning construction of a second dam in the province, will contribute approximately $200,000, some of which will be used for the creation of a new protected area in the watershed of the new reservoir and the remainder will go towards the management of the Phouchomvoy Protected Area in the upper watershed.   Bolikhamxay Province and the northern Annamite Mountains is a long-term priority for the WCS, and thus WCS will continue to provide resources towards their conservation through funding of senior managerial and technical staff.  WCS has also raised $200,000 from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation for 2009-2010, primarily focused on the management of the Nam Kading Protected Area, but some of which will be used for the conservation of eastern Bolikhamxay.  WCS is committed to raising additional funds for the conservation of this area.  In the past WCS has received funds for IEWMP work from MacArthur, the Global Environment Facility and the US Fish and Wildlife Service.  In the coming two years WCS is optimistic that at least $50,000 of funds from the USFWS-Great Apes Conservation Fund will be raised. <br/><br/>Sustainable Financing Mechanisms<br/>WCS and the Government of Laos have developed several pilot sustainable financing projects in Bolikhamxay Province. These include village level fish conservation zones (no-take zones along several rivers that act as source sites for sustainable fishing in other regions of the river), sustainable harvest of certain non-timber forest products which are then sold at increased prices through provincial government sponsors, and village level rice banks.  These projects are still in early stages and thus they may be significantly altered as the Integrated Ecosystem and Wildlife Management Project (IEWMP, the formal entity under which WCS works with the Government of Laos in Bolikhamxay Province) discovers what works best, but it is this category of activity that WCS and the Government of Laos would pursue in eastern Bolikhamxay with funding from LifeWeb.   <br/><br/>WCS and the Government of Laos are also currently exploring several other approaches to sustainable financing of protected areas in Bolikhamxay.  First there is scope for lands in the province to be a site for REDD-based funding as part of a comprehensive national REDD strategy.  WCS has prior experience demonstrating the value of protected areas as an effective emissions reduction tool in Cambodia and Madagascar.  This work has been reviewed by outside evaluators that have confirmed the verifiability and additionality of those emissions reductions. WCS is currently attempting to secure funding for generating baseline estimates of carbon stocks and deforestation rates in Bolikhamxay Province, two essential datasets for a REDD project.  WCS is also exploring ecotourism in Bolikhamxay Province, particularly as tourism in general is a growing industry in Laos.  However at its maximum ecotourism will likely generate only a relatively small amount of the overall revenue needed to sustain the protected areas and contribute to local economies.",

		"description": "This Project will focus on 19 discreet pilot sites across South Africa, spanning five of its nine biomes and six of its nine provinces. The aim of the Project is to work closely with local communities to secure high priority biodiversity land in the protected area network and simultaneously to deliver livelihood benefits. <br/><br/>Two of the pilot sites are located within the Maluti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Project (a project between South Africa and Lesotho) offering opportunities to further strengthen cross border cooperation and capacity on protected area expansion and management effectiveness. Several pilot sites are located within areas important for freshwater ecosystems and the delivery of potable freshwater as an ecosystem service. These cases offer opportunities to pilot the implementation of Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) toolkits as mechanisms for securing new protected areas.<br/><br/>The Project will operate at both macro and micro levels. At the macro level, knowledge sharing, networking and learning will take place with protected area agencies, land reform institutions and communities from across South Africa. At micro level the Project will operate in nineteen pilot sites in six provinces (Western Cape, Northern Cape, Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), Mpumalanga, and Limpopo). These two processes will work synergistically ensuring that learning and day-to-day implementation actions are strategically linked, allowing participants to 'learn from doing' and to draw out lessons and implications for national policy and institutional arrangements. In this way the Project seeks to maximize learning and adaptive management for both biodiversity and livelihoods results.<br/><br/>The location of the nine existing pilot sites is shown on the map (Figure 2). The labels refer to the sites described below. <br/><br/>A: Northern Cape Province – all three pilot sites are in the Kamiesberg in Namaqualand District Municipality. Roodebergskloof is near town of Garies; Tweerivier is near the village Tweerivier; and, Leliefontein near the village Leliefontein. <br/><br/>B: Western Cape Province – all three pilot sites are in the Winelands District Municipality. Genadendal is near Greyton; Klipfontein is next to Theewatersdam between Villiersdorp and Grabouw; and Fynbos Wyn and Vrugte is on the farm called Romansvlei and is near Wolseley.<br/><br/>C: KwaZulu Natal Province – Umgano is near Underberg.<br/><br/>D: KwaZulu Natal Province – Mabaso is in the Vryheid district near Pailpieterberg. <br/><br/>E: KwaZulu Natal Province – Somkhanda is in the Zululand District Municipality between Mkuze game reserve and town of Pongola inland from the Josini dam.<br/><br/>The proposed ten new pilot sites are located in the blue circles on the map (Figure 2) and consist of the following sites:<br/><br/>\tMpumalanga Province – three sites within the Wakkerstroom area between Wakkerstroom and Piet Retief. One of these sites is highly suitable for a PES pilot project as it is located in a high value water catchment.<br/>\tLimpopo Province –Moepel farms in the Waterberg region: three land restitution sites.<br/>\tNorthern Cape Province – near Kimberley: one site.<br/>\tEastern Cape Province – one PES site in the Umzimvubu catchment which is part of the Maluti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Conservation Area.<br/>\tKwaZulu-Natal Province – three new sites, one could be a PES pilot in Tugela catchment which is part of the Maluti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Conservation Area and the other two in Zululand District linking to Somkhanda to create a corridor.<br/><br/>Problem Statement<br/><br/>South Africa faces critical challenges relating to the need to protect her unique and highly diverse natural environment and alleviate high levels of poverty.  South Africa needs to protect her environment while dealing with environmental degradation and water scarcity, both of which will be heightened by the impacts of climate change, as well as implementing programmes and policies that seek to address poverty alleviation and the racial inequalities and injustices that the majority of the country’s citizens were subjected to in the recent past. South Africa’s rural areas are characterised by high levels of poverty, unemployment and land degradation in the former “homeland” areas juxtaposed with a highly sophisticated commercial agricultural sector, high value conservation areas and a mix of high to low value tourism and game ventures. Climate change will place further stress on freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, which is likely to lead to further land degradation and declining livelihoods. <br/><br/>As part of a broad programme to address poverty alleviation and racial inequalities, the government has since 1994 pursued a land reform programme aimed at giving access to land to the majority of people who were previously denied rights to own land. The land reform programme is laden with political, economic and emotional factors. There is the political need for equitable redistribution of productive resources so that access to and ownership of these resources reflects the demographics of the country in order to maximize opportunities for economic and social development. The emotional factor relates to the invisible scars people still carry due to the brutal nature of land dispossession, and the subsequent manner they were compelled to live their lives. The economic reality is that many land reform projects have failed to improve livelihoods and the socio-economic conditions of land reform beneficiaries. The recently elected government has committed itself to a renewed rural development programme in an effort to come to grips with this reality. Background information on land reform is contained in Annexure A.<br/><br/>Interventions/strategy<br/><br/>The challenge to reconcile biodiversity conservation imperatives with the broader redistribution and developmental agenda in South Africa needs to be met by a range of interventions. One such is the proposed “Improved Livelihoods and Protected Areas through Land Reform Stewardship Project”. This Project recognises the interdependence of environmental degradation and poverty, and has adopted an approach that views sustainable land management as the foundation of its activities. This approach ensures sustained ecosystem services, such as a steady supply of potable water, clean air, flood retention services and more – services that are essential for continued agricultural productivity, disaster reduction and for resilience to climate change. In South Africa, the phrase ‘biodiversity stewardship’ is linked to sustainable land management, and stewardship programs in the country assist landowners and landusers to make sustainable land use decisions, rehabilitate their land, and deliver biodiversity benefits in terms of national protected area targets. <br/><br/>* Please see also the attached Annexure A: Background on Biodiversity Stewardship and Land Reform in South Africa",

Biodiversity stewardship is voluntary and cannot be forced upon a landowner/user. Its implementation has developed from the bottom up through partnerships between landowners, conservation NGOs and provincial conservation agencies, mainly in the Western Cape and KZN, but is expanding to other provinces. Biodiversity stewardship operates along a continuum, from the creation of formal protected areas in terms of the Protected Areas Act (Act 57 of 2003), to biodiversity agreements in terms of the Biodiversity Act (Act 10 of 2004), to informal conservation areas (see the diagram in Annexure A which provides background on biodiversity stewardship and land reform). <br/><br/>The relationship between protected areas and land reform has tended to be controversial to date, with the focus usually on land claims in existing protected areas. Less attention has been paid to the opportunities for protected area expansion to actively support the land reform agenda and the diversification of rural livelihood options, especially in agriculturally marginal areas. Mutually beneficial scope exists for protected area expansion to work in partnership with land reform, through biodiversity stewardship programmes, with direct benefits for rural livelihoods.<br/><br/>Recognising the opportunity, SANBI and the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform (DRDLR) began work on a Land Reform Stewardship Initiative in November 2008. This initiative seeks to find the synergies between land reform and biodiversity conservation and to move beyond the traditionally oppositional relationship between the land sector and the biodiversity sector in South Africa. The proposed Project will build on this Land Reform Stewardship Initiative. <br/><br/>* Please see also the attached Annexure A:  Background on Biodiversity Stewardship and Land Reform in South Africa",

					"description": "This Project will focus on 19 discreet pilot sites across South Africa, spanning five of its nine biomes and six of its nine provinces. The aim of the Project is to work closely with local communities to secure high priority biodiversity land in the protected area network and simultaneously to deliver livelihood benefits. <br/><br/>Two of the pilot sites are located within the Maluti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Project (a project between South Africa and Lesotho) offering opportunities to further strengthen cross border cooperation and capacity on protected area expansion and management effectiveness. Several pilot sites are located within areas important for freshwater ecosystems and the delivery of potable freshwater as an ecosystem service. These cases offer opportunities to pilot the implementation of Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) toolkits as mechanisms for securing new protected areas.<br/><br/>The Project will operate at both macro and micro levels. At the macro level, knowledge sharing, networking and learning will take place with protected area agencies, land reform institutions and communities from across South Africa. At micro level the Project will operate in nineteen pilot sites in six provinces (Western Cape, Northern Cape, Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), Mpumalanga, and Limpopo). These two processes will work synergistically ensuring that learning and day-to-day implementation actions are strategically linked, allowing participants to 'learn from doing' and to draw out lessons and implications for national policy and institutional arrangements. In this way the Project seeks to maximize learning and adaptive management for both biodiversity and livelihoods results.<br/><br/>The location of the nine existing pilot sites is shown on the map (Figure 2). The labels refer to the sites described below. <br/><br/>A: Northern Cape Province – all three pilot sites are in the Kamiesberg in Namaqualand District Municipality. Roodebergskloof is near town of Garies; Tweerivier is near the village Tweerivier; and, Leliefontein near the village Leliefontein. <br/><br/>B: Western Cape Province – all three pilot sites are in the Winelands District Municipality. Genadendal is near Greyton; Klipfontein is next to Theewatersdam between Villiersdorp and Grabouw; and Fynbos Wyn and Vrugte is on the farm called Romansvlei and is near Wolseley.<br/><br/>C: KwaZulu Natal Province – Umgano is near Underberg.<br/><br/>D: KwaZulu Natal Province – Mabaso is in the Vryheid district near Pailpieterberg. <br/><br/>E: KwaZulu Natal Province – Somkhanda is in the Zululand District Municipality between Mkuze game reserve and town of Pongola inland from the Josini dam.<br/><br/>The proposed ten new pilot sites are located in the blue circles on the map (Figure 2) and consist of the following sites:<br/><br/>\tMpumalanga Province – three sites within the Wakkerstroom area between Wakkerstroom and Piet Retief. One of these sites is highly suitable for a PES pilot project as it is located in a high value water catchment.<br/>\tLimpopo Province –Moepel farms in the Waterberg region: three land restitution sites.<br/>\tNorthern Cape Province – near Kimberley: one site.<br/>\tEastern Cape Province – one PES site in the Umzimvubu catchment which is part of the Maluti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Conservation Area.<br/>\tKwaZulu-Natal Province – three new sites, one could be a PES pilot in Tugela catchment which is part of the Maluti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Conservation Area and the other two in Zululand District linking to Somkhanda to create a corridor.<br/><br/>Problem Statement<br/><br/>South Africa faces critical challenges relating to the need to protect her unique and highly diverse natural environment and alleviate high levels of poverty.  South Africa needs to protect her environment while dealing with environmental degradation and water scarcity, both of which will be heightened by the impacts of climate change, as well as implementing programmes and policies that seek to address poverty alleviation and the racial inequalities and injustices that the majority of the country’s citizens were subjected to in the recent past. South Africa’s rural areas are characterised by high levels of poverty, unemployment and land degradation in the former “homeland” areas juxtaposed with a highly sophisticated commercial agricultural sector, high value conservation areas and a mix of high to low value tourism and game ventures. Climate change will place further stress on freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, which is likely to lead to further land degradation and declining livelihoods. <br/><br/>As part of a broad programme to address poverty alleviation and racial inequalities, the government has since 1994 pursued a land reform programme aimed at giving access to land to the majority of people who were previously denied rights to own land. The land reform programme is laden with political, economic and emotional factors. There is the political need for equitable redistribution of productive resources so that access to and ownership of these resources reflects the demographics of the country in order to maximize opportunities for economic and social development. The emotional factor relates to the invisible scars people still carry due to the brutal nature of land dispossession, and the subsequent manner they were compelled to live their lives. The economic reality is that many land reform projects have failed to improve livelihoods and the socio-economic conditions of land reform beneficiaries. The recently elected government has committed itself to a renewed rural development programme in an effort to come to grips with this reality. Background information on land reform is contained in Annexure A.<br/><br/>Interventions/strategy<br/><br/>The challenge to reconcile biodiversity conservation imperatives with the broader redistribution and developmental agenda in South Africa needs to be met by a range of interventions. One such is the proposed “Improved Livelihoods and Protected Areas through Land Reform Stewardship Project”. This Project recognises the interdependence of environmental degradation and poverty, and has adopted an approach that views sustainable land management as the foundation of its activities. This approach ensures sustained ecosystem services, such as a steady supply of potable water, clean air, flood retention services and more – services that are essential for continued agricultural productivity, disaster reduction and for resilience to climate change. In South Africa, the phrase ‘biodiversity stewardship’ is linked to sustainable land management, and stewardship programs in the country assist landowners and landusers to make sustainable land use decisions, rehabilitate their land, and deliver biodiversity benefits in terms of national protected area targets. <br/><br/>* Please see also the attached Annexure A: Background on Biodiversity Stewardship and Land Reform in South Africa",

		"description": "The Caucasus forms an ecoregion  that has been identified by environmental scientists as having the highest level of bio-diversity in a temperate climate zone in the world. It is one of only 34 so-called “bio-diversity hotspots” worldwide according to Conservation International.  <br/><br/>Broadly, the ecoregion includes, from north to south, the Caucasus republics of Russia descending from the northern slope of the greater Caucasus mountain range, and the countries of Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia, as well as relatively small corners of Turkey and Iran to the south. The entire ecoregion is about the size of France. The recently independent countries of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia are at the region’s core and form about 40% of its land mass, and the CPAF's priority is to support those three countries.  Armenia and Georgia have confirmed their commitments to work with the CPAF.  Since confirmation from Azerbaijan is still outstanding, this profile refers principally to Armenia and Georgia.<br/><br/>The main strategy of both countries for conserving the world class biodiversity is their protected areas (PA) network, which provides significant environmental and economic benefits to the region’s people. These include watershed maintenance and carbon storage in its old growth forests, which are among the largest in a temperate zone and are home to most of the unique flora and fauna.  <br/><br/>The two counties also recognize that their conservation agendas go hand in hand with sustainable development. Ultimately, conservation goals will not be reached unless the rural communities surrounding protected areas benefit. The main potential the countries’ PA networks to generate revenue for local communities lies in the possibility of showcasing the natural beauty through tourism and related natural resource management (NRM) opportunities such as sustainable hunting.  <br/><br/>The PAs in both countries are significantly underfunded. Recent Protected Area Financial Scorecards prepared in connection with Global Environment Facility (GEF) projects in Armenia and Georgia indicate gaps in the annual funding of the PA systems of at least $3 million per country. Proposals for CPAF pilot financing projects in both Armenia and Georgia indicate that basic equipment for managing the target PAs is lacking, and, in one case, salaries of PA personnel are woefully inadequate.<br/><br/>Further, at this stage in the development of the three countries, the financing and management of the PA networks are lacking in transparency and efficiency. Business planning, expense control and budgeting at the PA level are works in progress. Programs to inventory and monitor bio-diversity are non-existent or ineffective. Tourism and natural resources management (NRM) provide basically no revenue to the system today. Maintenance of PA infrastructure is hit or miss depending on the availability of funding.    <br/><br/>In sum, the asset represented by the region’s nature and bio-diversity is not being sustainably used, and the threats posed by poaching, illegal logging and unsustainable development generally persist, with potentially irremediable consequences.",

In the three core countries, various steps towards that goal have already been taken, and important forthcoming measures include the creation of at least five new major protected areas over the next four to five years.  <br/><br/>The ECP’s trans-national approach is essential given the number and size of the countries and territories that form the eco-region. Many of the areas to be protected lie on borders, and animals require the eco regional—and not the political—space for their migration, breeding and feeding. The governments in the region have agreed in principle to back this effort. This cooperation has particular significance in a region with lingering territorial conflicts. <br/><br/>Under the ECP, the PAs are integrated into the overall land-use plans which include sustainable use and community-based management of natural resources outside the PA borders. In this way, it is planned that the ECP and PAs will involve and receive the support of local rural communities. This will be as crucial to their success as the support of the governments. <br/><br/>The CPAF’s mission is therefore to support the ongoing operations and maintenance of the protected areas in the region that are in priority areas under the ECP. <br/><br/>There are over 50 existing PAs managed by about 25 PA administtrative units within Armenia and Georgia. Most already existed in one form or another prior to the demise of the USSR. About 15 of the PAs are major national parks and strict nature reserves. Of these larger PAs, a number have benefited from international donor funds in recent years, including grants from Germany’s BMZ, Norway and the World Bank. These grants, however, typically do not assure long-term funding for ongoing operating and maintenance costs. <br/><br/>The ECP’s planned expansion of the system of protected areas will be of limited value if their ongoing operations cannot be funded. As in much of the developing world, there is a serious risk that PAs in the these countries end up as “paper parks”, i.e., PAs that are demarcated as protected on a map but which in reality are poached and exploited much as unprotected land. The CPAF’s primary focus is therefore to tackle this unaddressed but critical need.",

		"alignment": "The Government of Georgia adopted the law on Protected Areas System in 1996, putting the PA network under a firm legal footing. Furthermore, the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) adopted in 2005 defined 10-year strategic goals and objectives for Georgia in the area of biodiversity protection and identified actions to achieve those goals and objectives. Among others, development of protected areas system in order to ensure conservation and sustainable use of biological resources is considered as one of the strategic goals of the NBSAP with a number of specific objectives ranging from establishment of effective protected areas system, improvement of planning, management and financing of PAs to increasing of education and awareness on PAs. The Georgian Basic Data and Directions (BDD), setting-up the government medim-term expenditure framework for the period of 2006-2010 also considers the development of protected areas system and ecotourism as one of the top priority areas for the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of Georgia. Georgia now has a system of protected areas covering about 482,842 ha of land or 7% of the country’s territory. The system is composed of 39 protected areas (PAs) of the different management categories presented in the table below. The PA network has grown to include 21 nature reserves, four national parks, three national monuments, eleven managed reserves and one protected landscape. Until 2008, all protected areas were managed by the Department of Protected Areas (DPA). The DPA was replaced in January 2008 by the newly created parastatal, the Agency for Protected Areas (APA), under the oversight of the Ministry of Environment. The APA has begun the process of developing its own internal management policies and systems. Protected areas represent the cornerstone of Georgia’s biodiversity conservation strategy, as reflected in the government’s commitment to achieve a 20.2% coverage (1,417, 522 ha) by 2010 by establishing new protected areas and enlarging some of the existing ones. For this purpose, Georgia has developed a very comprehensive programme on protected areas and strong partnerships with numerous international organizations, such as the World Bank, the EU, BMZ/KfW/GTZ, Governments of US and Norway, IUCN, WWF, Conservation International, etc.<br/><br/>The Government of Armenia has established a network of protected areas which covers about 337,000 ha or 11.3% of the territory of Armenia. If Lake Sevan is excluded, the total percentage drops to 7.1%. The existing network is underfunded. Four types of protected areas are recognised under the “Law on Specially Protected Natural Areas (2006) – State Reserves (equivalent to IUCN category Ia) of which there are three (total area 36,104 ha), National Parks (equivalent to IUCN category II) of which there are three (total terrestrial area 86,165 ha and surface area of Lake Sevan 125,200 ha), Sanctuaries (equivalent to IUCN category IV) of which there are 25 (total area 89,526 ha), and Natural Monuments (equivalent to IUCN category III) for which the list is under revision (see Map 1). In the recent years the Government has created a number of legal and institutional prerequisites for increasing the financial sustainability of the PA system, which serve a positive baseline for the project. Thus, there is a Strategy on Developing Specially Protected Areas and National Action Plan (2003) which contains a PA financing part. The Protected Area Law was most recently amended in 2006 with support from a World Bank project.<br/><br/>Both countries have National Action Plans for biodiversity conservation.",

		"title": "Strengthening Marine Resource Management Across the Samaná bay Protected Area Complex in the Face of Climate Change",
		"summary": "Samaná Bay, a priority site for protection and one of the largest and most productive estuaries in the country, is an important humpback whale breeding area and home to large numbers of endemic species and important habitats including mangroves and seagrass beds, which in addition to providing spawning and recruitment areas, have been shown globally to sequester carbon on the same order as terrestrial forests.<br/><br/>Dwindling vital marine resources and biodiversity in a highly complex seascape increasingly threatened by unsustainable uses are risking the region's main economy and the livilihoods of hundreds fishers and tourism dollars generated from whale watching.",
		"description": "Samaná Bay is situated on the Dominican Republic’s northeastern coast bordering with the Atlantic Ocean and is one of the largest estuaries in the Caribbean. Best known for its high concentration of breeding Humpback Whales during the winter months, the bay has been considered a priority site for protection since the early 1980’s. In addition to tourism dollars generated from whale watching, the bay provides livelihoods for hundreds of fishers who compete for dwindling marine resources in a highly complex seascape increasingly threatened by unsustainable uses. To protect the critical ecosystem services the bay provides, the government has established a network of seven protected areas throughout the bay and surrounding areas. These protected areas range from Scientific Reserves to Natural Monuments, including Los Haitises and Manglares del Bajo Yuna National Parks, both playing important socioeconomic roles for neighboring communities, particularly fishing communities. The Marine Mammal Sanctuary Bancos de la Plata y la Navidad also provides important protection to wildlife and natural cycles that sustain the main economic sectors in the area (e.g. tourism and fishing).<br/><br/>Due to nutrient-rich waters supplied by the outflow of the Yuna and Barracote rivers, the Samaná Bay possesses ideal nursery conditions that have sustained large fisheries of commercially valuable species, including shrimp, lobster, and conch over the centuries. For example, approximately 34% of the country’s shrimp production comes from Samaná Bay – but the fisheries are rapidly being depleted. Important habitats include mangroves and seagrass beds, which in addition to providing spawning and recruitment areas, have been shown globally to sequester carbon on the same order as terrestrial forests. Management and enforcement of these areas are often non-existent, despite the beneficial effect they would have on ecosystem processes and fisheries. In addition, circulation patterns, life cycles of economically important marine species, and the location of nursery and recruitment grounds are poorly understood, making efficient management impossible. In addition to rising illegal fishing pressures both in and outside the marine protected areas, sediment loads into the bay have increased as deforestation and coastal development expand, smothering coral reefs and seagrass beds, directly affecting the viability and production of nursery grounds. Climate change, expected to raise temperatures, increase runoff and siltation, and produce other changes in the bay will threaten to extinguish the biodiversity of the bay if the resilience of the marine habitat is not improved.<br/><br/>Marine protected areas (MPAs) are being recognized as a strategic management tools aiding governments with the challenge of declining marine ecosystems worldwide. A major role of MPAs is the preservation of healthy and productive ecosystems which in turn secure viable populations of species, robust genetic pools and functional ecological processes. Thus MPAs represent a cornerstone of efforts to build resilience to climate change as their healthy ecosystems stand a better chance against a rapidly changing environment. In Samaná Bay, the surrounding network of marine protected areas was originally established to protect critical ecosystems such us mangrove forests, seagrass beds and coral reef formations. Today, the network stands out in spite of management and enforcement weaknesses, because it retains potential nursery and settlement sites with the least human interventions. These protected sites benefit the wider bay ecosystem as marine connectivity provides a spillover effect to adjacent areas.<br/><br/>As government representatives, the State Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (Secretaría de Estado del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, SEMARENA) and Dominican Council for Fishing and Aquaculture (El Consejo Dominicano de Pesca y Acuicultura, CODOPESCA) have expressed interest in institutional collaboration with TNC for the common goal of strengthening management of critical areas and fisheries within the bay. Activities in this proposal support development of concurrent management and planning activities described under “Financial Sustainability”.<br/><br/>The joint effort would address challenges both inside and outside marine protected areas as we work together on designing a sustainably-managed marine ecosystem resilient to climate change. In order to fulfill this common goal, this project aims to provide biological and socio-economic information critical management, to develop and implement monitoring plans for adaptive management and to return data on climate change stresses, and to sponsor a pivotal co-management agreement for the bay.<br/><br/>1. Determine the impact of siltation, a threat that will increase with climate change, on the ecology of the bay, on priority species, and on resource accessibility and uses by nearby communities. The Yuna and Barracote rivers supply the main freshwater inflow that provides estuarine conditions for the large fisheries of commercial value (e.g. shrimp fishery). Documented increases in sedimentation rate from these rivers were identified as a major threat to biodiversity and fisheries within the bay (Kramer, 2005). The project will <br/><br/>2. Provide basic information on hydrology and life cycles critical to fisheries and biodiversity management. Data show that unsustainable fishing practices are rapidly depleting fish stocks and represent a priority threat to biodiversity. The government requires basic information on life cycles and connectivity in the ecosystem to be able to better understand and effectively manage the bay. We will document life cycles within the bay for three species that sustain neighboring fishing communities – shrimp, lobster, conch (Strombus sp) – and at least two bone fish species (to be determined). This includes location of nursery grounds and other habitats critical to life cycles (such us recruitment grounds). Further analysis will be conducted in order to create a proposal for special management of these critical grounds as “fishery reserves” or “marine reserves”, in order to build ecosystem resilience to climate change by providing refugia than can serve as a source of population replenishment should climate disasters occur. CODOPESCA and SEMARENA anticipate the results for use in management.<br/><br/>3. Socio-economic study of three important communities. Empowerment of local communities to participate in management – potentially including sharing enforcement, monitoring, and sustainable practices, and potential co-management agreements – is an important element of GODOPESCA’s strategy. Understanding these communities is a necessary step in that process. As part of the project, CODOPESCA will work with three important communities – Sánchez, Sabana de la Mar and Samaná – to conduct socio-economic studies following CODOPESCA’s protocols. The studies will analyze women´s role in sustainable management of fisheries in the bay and provide a preliminary analysis of the effects of climate change in economy at the family level.<br/><br/>4. Census of fishers to understand fishing effort: Sustainable management of a marine ecosystem also requires reliable statistics on the fishing effort, which are currently incomplete for Samaná Bay. A census of fishers will provide base line information such as: number of fishermen and their license status, statistics on fishing boats, fishing gear statistics, fishing grounds information, and data on landings at selected sites. Combined with the socio-economic studies, the census will support CODOPESCA’s ongoing efforts to establish a long term management plan for the fishery sector in Samaná Bay.<br/><br/>5. Monitoring plan for fisheries: As management of Samaná Bay proceeds, data on current status of resources and threats, accountability for documented changes, effectiveness in the use of available funding, and staff improvement will be critical for adaptive management. The project will support CODOPESCA on the implementation of a landings-based monitoring system. A total of four monitoring sites will be evaluated and participating staff will receive training on basic fishery assessment methodologies used by CODOPESCA. In addition, the project will support long term results by providing monitoring equipment and a training manual to guide ongoing monitoring efforts by the government.<br/><br/>6. Monitoring plan for marine areas of national parks: “Los Manglares del Bajo Yuna” and “Los Haitises” National Parks are important contributors to the ecosystem of the bay, but under authority of SEMARENA. The project will also design monitoring plans for these two parks. This planning process will be carried out in collaboration with SEMARENA in order to improving effective management at the site level. Once more, the project will aim to support long term results by providing monitoring equipment and also by developing a training manual to guide ongoing monitoring efforts by the government. <br/><br/>7. Co-management agreement for Sánchez: Lastly, the project will support CODOPESCA on its efforts to design and deploy the first Fishery Co-management Agreement in Samaná Bay. CODOPESCA will be leading this management effort with the community of Sánchez, where fishing is the main economic activity sustaining families. The agreement will take into account conflict management, community active participation in resource management, fishing regulations and restrictions and the provisions for better economic incomes (e.g. through alternative livelihoods, sustainable financing mechanisms for fishers, certification of fishery products, added values to fishery products, etc.) The Conservancy is currently leading other conservation efforts that complement the long term goal of this proposal for Samaná Bay. Current efforts include the development of the Conservation Area Plans (CAPs) for national parks which will be rolled into their respective Management Plans elaborated by SEMARENA. Also, as part of the USAID Environmental Protection Program (USAID-EPP), a marine zoning scheme is being designed for Samaná Bay, in partnership with the Center for the Conservation and Eco-Development of Samaná Bay and its Surroundings (CEBSE) for the purposes of demonstrating effective use of a range of marine tools for planning processes. In addition, the USAID-EPP is financing a three year pilot project for creating self-sustainable community associations in Samaná Bay.<br/><br/>The Convention on Biological Diversity The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is an international Non-Government Organization (NGO) committed to support Caribbean nations to comply with the commitments of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). One of our main institutional commitments is to collaborate with the region’s governments to strengthen National Systems of Protected Areas by supporting the implementation of the Convention’s Program of Work on Protected Areas. Early during this process of international agreements, TNC established an official collaborative relationship with the Dominican Republic (DR) government with the signature of the National Implementation Support Programme Agreement (NISP Agreement) by both parties in 2006. Considered as a highly strategic alliance, the results from this partnership have been outstanding. In 2008, TNC delivered the Biological Gap Assessment, and in 2009 a Financial Gap Analysis and Capacity Assessment of the National System of Protected Areas. The integration of these components is currently underway through the development of the country’s first Master Plan of Protected Areas. In addition, the DR government recently declared a total of 31 new protected areas, where important consideration was given to the technical report of the Biological Gap Assessment previously delivered.<br/><br/>Even as the declaration of new protected areas is advancing with great success, we continue to move forward with other goals and commitments acquired through the Convention on Biological Diversity. Today our alliance is facing up to the challenge of effective management within the National System of Protected Areas. As stated in the Program of Work on Protected Areas (Objective 1.5), there is a strong need to mitigate/eliminate major threats to protected areas and their natural resources. The new challenge involves the deployment of management structures and tools that integrate sustainable uses of coastal and marine resources with protection of biodiversity in marine protected areas across the country. <br/><br/>Marine Protected Areas and Adaptation to Climate Change The project is set to benefit the management of a range of marine protected areas within the bay, while also providing focus on critical habitats that will require adaptation to climate change impacts. Specifically the project aims towards the following objectives:<br/><br/>A) Identifying and mapping critical nursery grounds and supporting habitats that must be managed to preserve biodiversity and human well-being in the bay.<br/><br/>B) Providing understanding on the overall dynamics within the bay and how current threats will change with climate change.<br/><br/>C) Building resilience of the ecosystem of Samaná Bay by reducing major current threats including overfishing, identifying and strengthening refugia, and characterizing fisheries so that they may be managed sustainably now and as climate changes.<br/><br/>D) Positioning the government to be able to better manage these marine resources by obtaining reliable baseline data necessary to monitor the effects of climate change and for modifying climate adaptation strategies over time.<br/><br/>E) Building resilience into the bay by reducing the most harmful anthropogenic threats. Unsustainable fisheries account for a direct degradation of ecosystems through destructive practices such as the use of poison, anchoring in coral reefs, selective fishing of juveniles and pregnant females, destruction of mangrove roots for oyster harvesting ,and the use of illegal-sized nets that kill juveniles of many species including by-catch species. The stakes are high on a collapsing food chain and reaching a threshold of no recovery for degraded and fragmented ecosystems.<br/><br/>As stated above the joint management of MPAs and important areas for fishing is a crucial step towards facing the many challenges of climate change. The interconnection between them demands collaborative efforts among communities, Government Organizations (GOs) and NGOs in order to pull together comprehensive management plan protecting people and nature.",

A major breakthrough on this topic was CODOPESCA’s development of a standard format for cooperation agreements that can be established with any stakeholder, from community-based association to international NGOs, for the purposes of fishery co-management. In addition, communication campaigns on fishery regulations and initial socio-economic studies of fishing communities have all recently been implemented by CODOPESCA. <br/><br/>These and many other efforts are moving fisher communities towards empowerment to manage the resources that sustain their livelihoods.

The organization will continue assisting local stakeholders with both technical and financial support through the Conservancy’s Marine Program. Among the Conservancy’s current investments at this marine site, we are providing updated regional Geographic Information System (GIS) data and tools to the Caribbean Decision Support System (CDSS, a $2.2 million investment), with improved conservation and socio-economic data readily available to GOs, communities and conservation partners. This support system is available for planning processes at both the national and site level scale and offers managers a set of analytical tools and models that can support decisions regarding natural resources management.

These efforts include the development of the Conservation Area Plans (CAPs) for the two national Parks mentioned above (Manglares del Bajo Yuna and Los Haitises) as part of the USAID funded “Dominican Alliance for Sustainable Tourism Project”. These documents are part of SEMARENA’s protocol for elaborating their respective Management Plans in the short term. As part of the USAID Environmental Protection Program (USAID-EPP), TNC is also leading a marine zoning scheme for<br/>Samaná Bay, in partnership with CEBSE. This planning effort takes into account multiple stakeholders including tourism, fishing, protected areas and marine commercial transportation within the bay. The project aims to demonstrate the effective use of a range of marine tools for planning purposes; and it includes workshops and training sessions for stakeholders involved. Lastly, the USAID-EPP is also financing a three year project focused on building a collaborative relationship with selected fishermen and women’s associations within the bay; the aims of this pilot initiative include creating self-sustainable community associations, building technical capacities and providing funding assistance for improvements on local conditions (e.g. office equipments, fishing gears, etc.).<br/><br/>Long -term sustainability of current efforts is also being addressed by the Conservancy and partners at a regional scale with creation of the National Protected Areas Trust Fund; a financial mechanism supported by the DR government, currently underway as part of the country’s commitment to the CBD.

		"description": "Costa Rica is rapidly loosing its wetlands. Threats to these ecosystems do not only come from direct human activities (like for example, land use change, advance in agriculture front, pollution, sediments, infrastructure construction, changes in headwaters of drainages, aquaculture projects and illegal extraction, among others), but also from climate change (soil warming, alteration of climate patterns and sea level increase). These ecosystems are considered to be very fragile in general and especially when facing climate change and are threatened the most today.<br/><br/>Mangroves represent 1% of national territory, with more tan 127 mangroves covering around 42.000 hectares. 99% of them are concentrated in the Pacific shore and the rest in the Caribbean. Costa Rica contains 0.002% of the Earth´s mangroves; and are habitat of rare, threatened and in extinsion species as for example the red ara (Ara macao) in the Central and South Pacific, the pink spatula bird (Ajaia ajaja), the ant tangara (Habia atrimaxillaris), the caiman (Caiman crocodylus), the boa (Corallus sp.), the white faced, the congo and the squirrel monkeys. In addition, they are the only hábitat for a few endemic species, such as, the mangrove reinita (Dendroica petechia xanthoera). Because they are so biodiverse areas, mangroves also represent an important genetic resource, which in the futurecould be highly valuable for the production of medicinal drugs. Also, mangroves are considered as one of the most productive ecosystems on earth. In the particular case of Costa Rica, the mangrove formations in the Nicoya Gulf could be constributing for the estuarine system to be one of the most productive in the world. The Pacific mangroves of Costa Rica, just as in the rest of the world, have been degraded and destroyed over the years. For the Nicoya Gulf shore a 6.7 % cover loss has been calculated from 1964 to 1989. In 1986, 13 of the 35 described mangrove areas were catalogued as degraded or highly altered,the rest showed some degree of alteration or in the course of recovering.In the Caribbean a similar situation has been happening but not been documented.<br/><br/>In Costa Rica, among the main causes of mangrove loss we can mention the following: Shrimp aquaculture. The mangroves of “estero Chomes” have been devastated up to 80% from an aquaculture Project. Organic, pesticides, hydrocarbon and solid waste pollution. The advance of the agricultura front and in general land use change. The expansion of cattle areas and development of agriculture have become important threats to most of the south Pacific mangroves. There are more and more mangroves turned into ranching or agricultura areas, running the risk the this development front keep expanding into the mangroves and its buffer areas. Urban development or industry. A clear example of this the Mata Limón mangrove in Puntarenas where part of its destruction is attributed to road and the Caldera harbor construction. These actions caused important changes in topography, ocean tides and normal fluxes into the mangroves; which consequently derived in the death of many fish and bivalves. House building using mangrove materials affects the mangroves due to a lack in planning as well as in managing generated waste. This is the case in Chacarita, Bejuco, Zapote, Estero Negro, Río Savegre and others. There are important changes in water and sediment pulses from the feeding rivers due to deforestation, agriculture practices and dam building. The effects of these changes are augmented from the accompanying pesticides generated form agriculture in the drainage area. The Terraba-Sierpe mangroves constitute the tip of a large watershed where over 63% of it is under serious erosion. These mangroves are the largest in extension (15.000 ha) in Costa Rica and are declared as a RAMSAR site under the influence of the Río Grande de Térraba and Río Sierpe watersheds (4.767 km2 and 1.966 km2 respectively). These mangroves are among the highest (30 m) and more dense of the central american Pacífic. Apart from habitat to many rare and threatened species mentioned before, they maintain another endemic species, the mangrove hummingbird (Amazilia boucardi). The plant species present are Rhizophora mangle (Rhizophoraceae, red mangrove or cat), R. harrisonii (Rhizophoraceae, gentleman mangrove), Avicennia germinans (Avicenniaceae, salt mangrove), A. tonduzii (Avicenniaceae, salt mangrove), Laguncularia racemosa (Combreataceae, ladybug mangrove), Pelliciera rhizophorae (Pellicieraceae, acorn mangrove), Achrostichum aureum (Pteridaceae, mangrove fern), and there is also Mora oleifera (alcornoque or mora) a south American tree species. 70 % of the present mangrove in Terraba-Sierpe is protected under the category of National Wetland (category VI UICN) which includes a permission to extractive and productive activities. From these mangroves they extract bark for tannins; carbon and wood for cooking and house building. They are also areas for aquaculture, agriculture, salt production, living, hunting of mammals and reptiles. There is mussel collecting as one of the most important subsistence and commercial ways of living.<br/><br/>The Gulf of Nicoya harbors 20 mangroves covering 112 km of shore line, representing around 15.400 ha. 50% of it is protected as Wildlife Reserves (category II UICN).

Two of the priority areas have been selected for protection as they contain most of the unprotected mangroves. In the gap analysis only 42% (17.855 ha) of existing mangroves in Costa Rica are within the National Protected Areas. As a consequence, the government has reached a decision of incorporating 12,000 ha as mangrove protected areas. This decision implies the creation of new areas or extension of pre-existing areas but with management categories that permit a more successful conservation of mangroves. <br/><br/>Two MPAs will be created and/or expanded through the project to increase mangrove cover and to improve their ecological representation in Chira-Tempisque and Dominical-Terraba systems. Management plans will be developed for the newly created and/or expanded MPAs. Management plans will include biological monitoring mechanisms to assess conservation impacts and will incorporate a strategy to mitigate climate change.

		"ecological_contribution": "Costa Rican coastal and marine ecosystems are largely under-represented in the PAS, including sandy and rocky beaches, rocky and soft sea bottoms, coral communities and sea grasses of the Pacific Ocean, upwelling zones, and congregation areas for whales, whale sharks, lobsters, and fish. New MPAs are also needed to protect coastal areas and most of the oceanic areas of biological importance. Currently, only 21 of the total number of conservation areas (i.e. 169) are MPAs, and these cover only 5,140 km2, or 1% of the country’s jurisdictional waters. The recently concluded Coastal and Marine Conservation Gap Analysis (GRUAS II) identified 34 areas (20,985 km2) that are in need of conservation, among which 12 areas (16,300 km2) are considered to be of high priority. Their management remains weak; for example, only a fraction of the MPAs have completed and updated their management plans. In addition, management skills within the PAs are weak and the financial sustainability of Costa Rica’s MPAs is far from being achieved. <br/><br/>The submarine mountains of Coco contain a diversity of substrata and under water hills usually harboring high primary productivity, congregations of pelagic fish and diverse sessil invertebrate communities (corals, octocorals, ascidians, sponges, briozooans, etc.). The area is identified as of interest includes 1,311 km2, which have no category of conservation. <br/><br/>Golfo Dulce has 1,153,4 km2 of interest; of which 983,3 km2 (85%) represent a conservation gap. It is a feeding site for marine birds and a nesting sites for marine turtles,a concentration site for cetaceans, Rhincodon typus and “piangua” banks. Its uniqueness resides in it containing an anoxic basin unlike any other in the tropics, with important coraline formations in danger of disappearing due to sedimentation. <br/><br/>Some important biological-ecological properties in Golfo Dulce are: <br/>1. It is the most accessible marine site and less dangerous (marinas conditions) for dolphin observation. Great communities of spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata) and the common bottle nose (Tursiops truncatus) are regulars in the area. <br/>2. Its coral reefs jointly with those from the Chiriqui Gulf in Panama are the oldest of the American Pacific. <br/>3. From December to March the presence of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) coming from north America are common from Caño Island to Golfo Dulce, and between July and September some community individuals of humpbacks from the south come with their young to Golfo Dulce. <br/>4. It is the nesting site of many marine species in the rocky shores and their mangroves (e.g. Needle Fish, snappers, etc.). <br/>5. It is common that pelagic species visit in these calm waters. Among them there are the large shark whales, fish schools and sometimes occasional orcas. <br/>6. Golfo Dulce has in its external area (Platanares and Punta Banco) some important sand beaches for Pacific turtle nesting (Ridley, Leatherback and Black). <br/><br/>When increasing the net of MPAs and incorporate the identified gaps for Golfo Dulce and Coco Island it will be consolidating, among others, the protection of: <br/>-Shark whale (Rhincondon typus) congregation areas <br/>-Hammer shark (Sphyrra spp.) congregation areas <br/>-The area where the only occurrence of the shark Odontaspis ferox; the gobiid fish Acanthemblemaria atrata and of the fish Plectrodromus leopardus have been recorded for the Eastern Tropical Pacific. <br/>-The area where the only occurrence of the endemics Axoclinus cocorensis; the gobiids Chriolepis atrimelim, Gobiesox fulvus and Lythrypinus cobalos as well as the sea bass Serranus tico and the scorpion fish Scorpoaena cocoensis have been recorded for the Eastern Tropical Pacific. <br/>-Congregation areas of marine mammals (humpbacks, blue whales, orca, false orca, spotted dolphin, tucuxi, bottle nose dolphin). <br/>-Nesting areas for the golfin turtle or olive green (Lepidochelys olivacea).",

		"description": "Home to and in the center of the world’s richest marine biodiversity, the Philippines’ marine ecosystems provide close to half the nation’s animal protein. It supports the economically critical fishing industry which employs more than two million people directly, and many more in ancillary fisheries-related and marine tourism industries – all of which depend on functioning marine ecosystems. <br/><br/>It is estimated that 1 km2 of healthy coral reef generates an average of US$50,000 annually from fishing and tourism. As a whole, Philippine coral reefs contribute at least US$1.4 billion annually to the economy, 1.4% of gross domestic product (World Bank 2005). With such rich resources, it is ironic that coastal communities who depend directly on fish and other coastal and marine resources for their livelihood are among the poorest in the Philippines with 4 of 10 coastal residents living at or below poverty level. Household income levels are as low as US$470 per year, compared to the national average of US$2,820 (World Bank 2005).<br/><br/>To protect this biodiversity and the human benefits it supports, the Philippines has invested heavily in the creation of Integrated Coastal Resource Management (ICRM) Plans, the cornerstone of which is a network of more than 1200 national and municipal Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). However, flaws in the existing MPA system abound – these include lack of community engagement in the creation and management of MPAs, a lack of biological and management networking between MPAs, and (depending on the objectives of the MPAs) an inadequate scale of individual MPAs. Together these systemic challenges are preventing the Philippines from reaping the full rewards of these investments in biodiversity protection.  <br/><br/>This project proposes to demonstrate how these issues can be overcome by using social marketing to re-engage communities in the management of their MPAs while simultaneously deploying selective technical support to allow those communities to act on their empowerment. With a successful track record in more than 50 countries to date, Rare is the world’s leader in social marketing for biodiversity conservation. Many of the world’s largest conservation groups have requested Rare’s services to help build stronger local community support for their work. This includes The Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund, Birdlife International, Audubon, the United Nations Environment Programme, the national governments of China, Mexico, Peru, and Indonesia, and many others. <br/><br/>Social marketing is a method for changing attitudes and behaviors that has been successfully applied by other organizations to such issues as seatbelt use, smoking, pollution, teen drug abuse, and reproductive health. Rare has a proven model for changing awareness, attitudes, and behaviors toward conservation at the local level. It’s called a “Pride” campaign, and it inspires people to take pride in the natural assets which are most valuable to their communities and to take action to protect them. Pride campaigns are intensive two year-long capacity-building and marketing efforts that borrow private sector tactics and apply them to promoting more environmentally sustainable practices. <br/><br/>Together with local implementing national and municipal government, and NGO, partners in the Philippines, Rare will manage Pride campaigns   at nine key marine sites around the country.  Networking and sustainability investments will be built into the program to facilitate the dissemination of lessons from successes and challenges at these sites to the broader national protected areas system.  Further, with more than 25% of the world’s MPAs (by number: 1200+ of the global total of ~4000 MPAs) being in the Philippines, investments to address this issue hold the potential to positively influence approaches to MPA creation and management throughout the world.<br/><br/>The expression of interest (EOI) for this project includes nine sites for Pride campaigns (final site selection is underway and is due to be complete by May 2010, please see map for current list of prospective sites and Local Implementing Partner candidates) and focuses on MPAs located in the coastal provinces of the Philippines, primarily in the Central Visayas and Mindanao regions. While the overall project costs are estimated across five-years at USD$ 4,000,000, this EOI specifically requests USD$ 650,000 (16% of the total project costs) to support the most critical two-year project component which focuses on social marketing training and campaign delivery.<br/><br/>The strategic and thematic lines of intervention for strengthening these MPAs are aimed at training and mentoring local Philippine National Government Agencies (in particular the Department of Environment and Natural Resources Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau), Local Government Units (LGUs) and NGO’s at multiple sites to engage communities in and around MPAs in a social marketing campaign to 1) Provide formal academic and in-the-field training to Philippine Local Implementing Partners in the science behind social and behavioral change; 2) Build a foundation for community-driven conservation through stakeholder participation; 3) Develop a targeted communication plan; 4) Launch a mass marketing campaign working with technical, political, or other partners to provide the right incentives for change and; 5) Establishing and implementing MPA management plans to sustain long term impact.<br/><br/>In more detail, the social marketing campaign will be implemented in parallel with strategies focused on building local capacity for MPA management through local MPA management councils and enforcement teams.  This two-pronged strategy will address the localized fisheries decline, intrusion into the no-take-zones of the MPA, and keep destructive fishing practices out of the villages and MPAs concerned whilst building a backbone of local institutional governance and support mechanisms to ensure continuity of the investments. To ensure success, these campaigns will demonstrate economic benefits, such as increased fish catch and where potential exists, a rise in ecotourism from healthier reefs building on the well documented model sites in the Philippines such as Apo Island and the municipality of Dauin, Negros Orientale province.)<br/><br/>The program will also build local and national capacity to engage local communities in a co-management agreement by strengthening existing tools for improving governance, planning and coordination of these protected areas, based on the results of effective biological, social and economic monitoring that focuses on self-sustainability,  socio-economic opportunities and economic and cultural benefits of the MPA. Local participation in management and the professionalization and implementation of services for protected area management capacity building is needed. Best practices will emerge and result in a MPA management toolbox to allow for easy replication to other critical marine sites in the country through the assisting organizations at the national Government level (DENR – PAWB) and at the local level together with Local Government Units (LGUs).",

		"ecological_contribution": "The marine resources of the Philippines are fundamental as they are the basis for socio-economic development of the country as a whole. The Philippines declared its first national marine park (the Hundred Islands) in 1940 which was followed by MPA designations at the local and national government levels in the 1970s and 1980s up to the present.  Under the National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS) Act of 1992, 28 national MPAs have been proclaimed that cover about 15,000 km2. The Philippines is also renowned for its 1,200 established municipal MPAs, that cover a further 500 km2, are managed by municipal and city governments through co-management arrangements, most of which contain no-take areas surrounded by some form of managed fishing areas. <br/><br/>Although there are many small and large MPAs in the Philippines, there are a variety of reasons for the fact that most MPAs fail to achieve their objectives. A common cited problem is the alienation of the local resource users from the establishment, planning and implementation process; another is the lack of genuine economic and socio-economic benefits that communities attribute to the MPA declaration. When outreach programs are weak, communities see the declaration of MPAs as reducing further their fishing grounds when fish stocks are already reduced. Local communities do not have the luxury of time to establish whether the MPA is working or not. Historically many of the established protected areas were done with minimal consultation or involvement with local stakeholders and management authorities (LGU’s) in the planning process. This leads to a situation where local stakeholders have little say and do not correlate benefits from the MPAs they live and glean from, leading to a situation wherein most MPAs (estimates range from 70-90% of those declared) are not functioning within the Philippines.<br/><br/>This project aims to support several major objectives of the CBD’s Protected Areas Programme of Work, to significantly reduce the rate of marine biodiversity loss and to contribute to poverty reduction and the pursuit of sustainable development. MPAs with multiple use objectives help meet specific goals relating to conservation and economic benefits. Success in the Philippines should not simply be considered in national terms, but presents a strong opportunity for replication at protected marine areas globally, especially given the large number of MPAs in the country.<br/>The project intends to enhance the country’s MPA management tools by:<br/>1)\tConducting at least nine social marketing campaigns in the Philippines to gain comprehensive acceptance of MPAs by local communities and ensure behavior is changed from negative perceptions of MPAs removing historical fishing grounds towards full support and involvement in management by the vast majority of local stakeholders.<br/>2)\tDeveloping an MPA management effectiveness toolkit that links together governance, social acceptability and biophysical objectives of the MPA. The project will develop a documented and available toolbox of best practices that will provide a road map and a series of benchmarks to ensure all the above objectives can be achieved for these pilot sites. The tool will provide a road map for charting out community engagement, MPA management plans and their governance.<br/>3)\tConduct capacity building for tools 1 and 2 and in finding the optimal co-management system for at least two MPAs per “learning area” (to be chosen yet) that builds on coordination of the resource managers, resource users and the National Governments role of capacity building for these and setting this governance system in place at 12-18 MPAs (achieving 10% of Philippine Medium term Development Plan targets) in partnership with 27 LGUs (achieving 5% of Philippine Medium Term Development targets) that covers at least 100km2 of MPA (LGU municipal waters) under improved management of which at least 5 km2 of No Take Zone.",

		"participation": "This project will contribute with the consolidation of co-management, advisory councils, elaboration and implementation of management plans based on the social and conservation agenda of the MPAs that promote sustainable economic activities (fishery, tourism, etc.) and conservation of marine biodiversity, in ways to contribute poverty reduction and accomplish the Millennium Goals. <br/><br/>While gender is not an explicit criterion for site or partner selection, it is very much factored into the proposed campaign approach. The surveys and community outreach engages women (and children) equally. <br/><br/>The community MPA governance will engage all segments of the local population. Further, the role of MPAs has a major impact on food security, which greatly affects women in their role as providers of food for the family and often as vendors of fish and seafood, as well as supporting food sources for the most marginalized fishers. This project recognizes important differences in how women and men use, manage, and conserve biological resources. Campaign planning integrates the understanding of gender-based differences and their implications for natural resources management and biodiversity conservation into conservation programs and policies. By giving women a clear role in biodiversity decision-making, the social acceptability and sustainability of MPA conservation and management efforts can be enhanced. Involving women is often the most effective avenue for generating behavioral change. Women and children are often the ones found gleaning in the buffer zones of the No-Take-Zones (NTZs) around the country that are dependent on the near-shore coral reef and seagrass habitats, while men are commonly associated with being the ones out in the deeper sea fishing for the migratory small and large pelagic fish.<br/><br/>The small-scale Philippine NTZs look small and insignificant on maps of the world; however they meet significant food security indicators and are in the marine “backyards” of 40% of the country’s burgeoning population that is fast approaching the one hundred million mark. Although the NTZs are small (sometimes as small as 0.005-0.02 Km2) these MPAs provide a significant food security buffer of highly nutritional animal protein in areas of few other sources. The buffer zones of the NTZs provide a regular supply of larvae and spawn of fish and invertebrates that provides the daily nutrition to these fast growing families living by the coast. During typhoons and windy weather when fishers cannot get to the deep sea, this is the local source of food protein.",

					"summary": "Home to and in the center of the world’s richest marine biodiversity, the Philippines’ marine ecosystems provide close to half the nation’s animal protein. It supports the economically critical fishing industry which employs more than two million people directly, and many more in ancillary fisheries-related and marine tourism industries – all of which depend on functioning marine ecosystems.",
					"description": "Home to and in the center of the world’s richest marine biodiversity, the Philippines’ marine ecosystems provide close to half the nation’s animal protein. It supports the economically critical fishing industry which employs more than two million people directly, and many more in ancillary fisheries-related and marine tourism industries – all of which depend on functioning marine ecosystems. <br/><br/>It is estimated that 1 km2 of healthy coral reef generates an average of US$50,000 annually from fishing and tourism. As a whole, Philippine coral reefs contribute at least US$1.4 billion annually to the economy, 1.4% of gross domestic product (World Bank 2005). With such rich resources, it is ironic that coastal communities who depend directly on fish and other coastal and marine resources for their livelihood are among the poorest in the Philippines with 4 of 10 coastal residents living at or below poverty level. Household income levels are as low as US$470 per year, compared to the national average of US$2,820 (World Bank 2005).<br/><br/>To protect this biodiversity and the human benefits it supports, the Philippines has invested heavily in the creation of Integrated Coastal Resource Management (ICRM) Plans, the cornerstone of which is a network of more than 1200 national and municipal Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). However, flaws in the existing MPA system abound – these include lack of community engagement in the creation and management of MPAs, a lack of biological and management networking between MPAs, and (depending on the objectives of the MPAs) an inadequate scale of individual MPAs. Together these systemic challenges are preventing the Philippines from reaping the full rewards of these investments in biodiversity protection.  <br/><br/>This project proposes to demonstrate how these issues can be overcome by using social marketing to re-engage communities in the management of their MPAs while simultaneously deploying selective technical support to allow those communities to act on their empowerment. With a successful track record in more than 50 countries to date, Rare is the world’s leader in social marketing for biodiversity conservation. Many of the world’s largest conservation groups have requested Rare’s services to help build stronger local community support for their work. This includes The Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund, Birdlife International, Audubon, the United Nations Environment Programme, the national governments of China, Mexico, Peru, and Indonesia, and many others. <br/><br/>Social marketing is a method for changing attitudes and behaviors that has been successfully applied by other organizations to such issues as seatbelt use, smoking, pollution, teen drug abuse, and reproductive health. Rare has a proven model for changing awareness, attitudes, and behaviors toward conservation at the local level. It’s called a “Pride” campaign, and it inspires people to take pride in the natural assets which are most valuable to their communities and to take action to protect them. Pride campaigns are intensive two year-long capacity-building and marketing efforts that borrow private sector tactics and apply them to promoting more environmentally sustainable practices. <br/><br/>Together with local implementing national and municipal government, and NGO, partners in the Philippines, Rare will manage Pride campaigns   at nine key marine sites around the country.  Networking and sustainability investments will be built into the program to facilitate the dissemination of lessons from successes and challenges at these sites to the broader national protected areas system.  Further, with more than 25% of the world’s MPAs (by number: 1200+ of the global total of ~4000 MPAs) being in the Philippines, investments to address this issue hold the potential to positively influence approaches to MPA creation and management throughout the world.<br/><br/>The expression of interest (EOI) for this project includes nine sites for Pride campaigns (final site selection is underway and is due to be complete by May 2010, please see map for current list of prospective sites and Local Implementing Partner candidates) and focuses on MPAs located in the coastal provinces of the Philippines, primarily in the Central Visayas and Mindanao regions. While the overall project costs are estimated across five-years at USD$ 4,000,000, this EOI specifically requests USD$ 650,000 (16% of the total project costs) to support the most critical two-year project component which focuses on social marketing training and campaign delivery.<br/><br/>The strategic and thematic lines of intervention for strengthening these MPAs are aimed at training and mentoring local Philippine National Government Agencies (in particular the Department of Environment and Natural Resources Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau), Local Government Units (LGUs) and NGO’s at multiple sites to engage communities in and around MPAs in a social marketing campaign to 1) Provide formal academic and in-the-field training to Philippine Local Implementing Partners in the science behind social and behavioral change; 2) Build a foundation for community-driven conservation through stakeholder participation; 3) Develop a targeted communication plan; 4) Launch a mass marketing campaign working with technical, political, or other partners to provide the right incentives for change and; 5) Establishing and implementing MPA management plans to sustain long term impact.<br/><br/>In more detail, the social marketing campaign will be implemented in parallel with strategies focused on building local capacity for MPA management through local MPA management councils and enforcement teams.  This two-pronged strategy will address the localized fisheries decline, intrusion into the no-take-zones of the MPA, and keep destructive fishing practices out of the villages and MPAs concerned whilst building a backbone of local institutional governance and support mechanisms to ensure continuity of the investments. To ensure success, these campaigns will demonstrate economic benefits, such as increased fish catch and where potential exists, a rise in ecotourism from healthier reefs building on the well documented model sites in the Philippines such as Apo Island and the municipality of Dauin, Negros Orientale province.)<br/><br/>The program will also build local and national capacity to engage local communities in a co-management agreement by strengthening existing tools for improving governance, planning and coordination of these protected areas, based on the results of effective biological, social and economic monitoring that focuses on self-sustainability,  socio-economic opportunities and economic and cultural benefits of the MPA. Local participation in management and the professionalization and implementation of services for protected area management capacity building is needed. Best practices will emerge and result in a MPA management toolbox to allow for easy replication to other critical marine sites in the country through the assisting organizations at the national Government level (DENR – PAWB) and at the local level together with Local Government Units (LGUs).",

Infrastructure and specialized equipment is also needed so PA officials can implement control, surveillance and monitoring activities in areas that pose specific gear demands: high mountain, marine and coastal areas.<br/><br/>Governance and management agreements will be developed and/or implemented for prioritized National Parks with overlapping or neighboring indigenous reserves or Afro-Colombian territories.<br/><br/>Participatory ecological restoration will continue to be implemented in National Parks prioritized for the opportunity to address, jointly with local communities, specific ecosystem deterioration processes such as forest fires, loss of hydric resources and connectivity loss.<br/><br/>A specific monitoring and research program will be developed and implemented to produce information to raise national and international public and scientific awareness and inform decisions about the effects of climate change in ten prioritized vulnerable PA associated with critical ecosystem services.<br/><br/>Social participation will continue to be an integral part of the evaluation of management effectiveness at the PA through a tool (AEMAPPS) applied in 2010 at 100% of the areas, and validated and supported by the WCPA.  The tool will inform adaptive management decisions, reveal improvements in reaching conservation goals and increase governance both at local and System levels.<br/><br/>All relevant information about the project progress and results will be efficiently made public through of the communications strategy of the National Parks Authority at local, regional, national and international levels, advancing in raising consciousness and awareness about the values, status and conservation needs of the PA, and promoting active involvement of private and public, national and international stakeholders.<br/><br/>The implementation of the Strategy for Economic and Financial Sustainability of the SPNN will be prioritized for ecosystem services.<br/><br/>SEE ANNEX 4:  Prioritization of conservation sites in Colombia.",

The islands chain extends over a distance of 1600km with a total area of 28,369km2 and Sea area (EEZ) of 1.34million sq km (National Environment Management Strategy, 1993:6).The islands are highly diverse with rare and endemic species of indigenous flora and fauna. <br/><br/>The Solomon Islands has 2,597 described plant species, 245 birds, 75 mammals, 87 reptiles, 19 amphibians, 777 fish and 1799 invertebrate species (IUCN 2008). Major threats to Solomon Islands biodiversity include: the ongoing threat of logging, mining, oil palm and other industrial agriculture and unsustainable fishing practices and the increasing threat from a rapidly expanding human population (3%/annum) and expanding conversion and degradation of forests through subsistence agriculture and cash crops and increase drought, storms and sea level rise as a consequence of climate change.  <br/><br/>Forest cover in the Solomon Islands has decreased from 80% in the 1990s to 60% today indicating a significant loss in biodiversity. The need to protect or conserve these forests is imperative to ensure that biodiversity of Solomon Islands is maintained. The current status of species in the Solomon Islands include: 2 extinct, 2 critically endangered, 10 endangered, 20 vulnerable, 184 near threatened species (IUCN 2008). These numbers are expected to rapidly increase over the next decade if we don't immediately expand and strengthen the existing protected area system. <br/><br/>Currently, there are about 42 protected areas in the Solomon Islands, 80 percent of which are in customary land ownership. These are largely being managed by local communities and NGOs, although the Government has supported a few of them. Most of these protected areas are marine sites. In early 90s eighteen new protected areas were proposed (Lees 1990).<br/><br/>Less that 1% of the Solomon Islands land and sea areas are protected.  It is a matter of great urgency to protect and effectively manage high priority areas (9% of the land and sea) identified as part of the Solomon Islands Ridges to Reefs National Gap Analysis.",

		"description": "Lying at the southern end of the Coral Triangle, the Lesser Sunda Ecoregion (LSE) stretches from Bali to Timor Leste, covering an area of more than 45 million hectares. Linking the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the LSE supports diverse and highly productive coral reef and pelagic habitats and is an important transition zone between Pacific and Indian faunas. Fish and coral diversity is extremely high in the LSE with 1,783 species of fish and 523 species of coral recorded (deVantier et al 2008, Veron et al. unpublished). The LSE has very high rates of endemism for both corals and fish. Eleven endemic species of coral were identified by Veron et al. (unpublished) (although some have since been recorded outside the LSE) and 25 endemic species of fish (De Vantier et al. 2008).  Strong currents and major seasonal cold-water upwellings generate incredible productivity and are likely to be key factors in conferring resilience to the growing threat of rising sea surface temperatures associated with climate change.  Many of these reefs are still in excellent condition though the main threats to coral reefs and coral reef fisheries are destructive, illegal, unreported and overfishing, reclamation and coastal development, unregulated expansion of aquaculture (in some places using methods which damage reefs and seagrass) and climate change.  There is still time to abate these threats due to the low population and early stage of coastal development. <br/><br/>This region is also regionally important migratory corridor and feeding ground for cetaceans with 18 species recorded to date including blue and sperm whales. Several islands in the area provide important nesting sites for endangered species of sea turtles and dugongs are commonly seen in coastal areas.  In the Lesser Sunda, coastal waters drop steeply to deep sea habitats favored by blue and sperm whales bringing them close to the coast. Migratory ‘bottlenecks’ in the narrow straits between the islands are also used as shipping lanes, fishing grounds and affected by coastal runoff.  The main threats to large marine life in the Lesser Sundas are poaching and hunting, entanglement in fishing gear, bycatch, ship strike, underwater noise, litter and other pollution. Many of these threats could be addressed through an effectively managed, resilient network of MPAs, careful spatial planning of coastal and catchment areas and improved fisheries management for the region. If properly protected, the Lesser Sunda Ecoregion could become a refuge for marine life and productive fisheries providing food security amid global climate change.<br/><br/>The Government of Indonesia is committed to developing networks of MPAs and have established or declared 13 million hectares of MPAs to date.  Over the coming years they are planning to strengthen the effective management of these existing MPAs and increase the area covered by MPAs to 20 million hectares by 2020 (Marine and Fisheries Ministerial Speech on the launching of Savu Sea MNP at Manado, 5 May 2009 ). The most important challenges to achieving these goals are development of adequate awareness, capacity, legal and policy frameworks and enabling conditions.  Indonesia’s recent decentralization policy gives a stronger mandate to local governments to manage natural resources in the areas under their jurisdiction.  This creates opportunities for new approaches such as the design and implementation of resilient MPA networks, but districts lack the capacity, skills and resources to manage their protected areas effectively. It has also resulted in a complex legal and administrative framework where the mandates of national, provincial and district government agencies are ill-defined and partly overlapping.  <br/><br/>The Government of Indonesia has requested support from TNC and its partners to assist in the development of enabling conditions to strengthen the existing MPAs and MPA networks, assist with identification of new areas for MPAs and to provide technical inputs into coastal and marine spatial planning which align with conservation and sustainable use of resources.  The province of East Nusa Tenggara in the Lesser Sundas Ecoregion will be one of the first provinces in Indonesia to develop a comprehensive coastal and marine spatial plan and will serve as a model for other regions of Indonesia. Developing effective management of the Savu Sea MNP is a high priority for the Government of Indonesia as a platform for sustainable fisheries and development of the region as well as poverty reduction.  <br/><br/>TNC and its partners have a long history of working closely with the Government of Indonesia on marine conservation and sustainable fisheries policy and are well positioned to support the development and implementation of an MPA network in the Lesser Sundas Ecoregion:<br/>• From 2006-2009, TNC identified a resilient network of Marine Protected Areas for the Lesser Sundas Ecoregion providing a strong information base and ‘roadmap’ for the development and implementation of an MPA network in this region.<br/>• In 2009, TNC supported the declaration and implementation of a the largest MPA in the Coral Triangle – the Savu Sea Marine National Park (3.5 million hectares) and facilitates management through the Team Savu – an intergovernmental team of experts and government agency representatives.<br/>• TNC is involved in a national think tank on marine conservation policies (Komite Nasional Konservasi Laut).  <br/>• TNC has a strong background in training, capacity building and development of the enabling conditions for effective MPA management. <br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>DeVantier, L., Turak, E., Allen, G. 2008 Lesser Sunda Ecoregional Planning Coral Reef Stratification: Reef and seascapes of the Lesser Sunda ecoregion.

The Nature Conservancy recently undertook an ecoregional planning exercise in the Lesser Sunda which included a gap analysis of the existing protected area network.  Many key habitats such as coral reefs and seagrass and key migratory corridors and feeding grounds for cetaceans, dugongs and turtles were underrepresented in the exsiting protected area network. In addition, improved management is needed at many existing MPAs to effectively reduce threats such as mangrove harvesting and overfishing.   TNC recently worked closely with the Government of Indonesia to identify a resilient network of Marine Protected Areas in the Lesser Sunda Ecoregion which includes 100 protected areas — 86 coastal reserves and MPAs for coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass that are linked to 14 larger offshore MPAs which encompass near shore yet deep sea habitats to protect cetaceans and other large marine fauna.  The MPA network also includes three proposed transboundary MPAs between Indonesia and Timor Leste.",

The mission number 3 and 4 stated :<br/>To implement a balanced conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.<br/>This will be achieved by enhancing ecosystems conservation, reducing the rate of their degradation, and developing biodiversity management and its sustainable use, in order to improve the welfare of Indonesian individuals and society in equitable, fair, responsible, balanced and sustainable manner. These efforts will be undertaken based on identification of existing problems, using approaches that balance the needs of conservation and sustainable use of biological resources for community welfare.<br/><br/>To strengthen institutions and law enforcement.<br/>This will be achieved by building and developing institutional capacity to formulate legal and policy instruments, as well as by empowering their law enforcement officials at the local, regional, and national levels. These will ensure order and legal certainty for the management of biodiversity in a fair, responsible, accountable, balanced and sustainable manner.<br/><br/>Furthermore there are five objectives, to obtain the above missions and Objective 1, 3 and 4 are particularly fit well with the purpose of the project.<br/>Objective 1:<br/>To develop the quality of Indonesian individuals and society who are concerned with the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.<br/><br/>Especially under Goal 1.3 : There is a progress in the partnership between indigenous, local, regional and national community groups with international and global communities in the management, utilization and conservation of biodiversity in a fair, balanced, responsible, accountable and sustainable manner.<br/><br/>Objective 3:<br/>To reduce and stop the rate of biodiversity degradation and extinction at the national, regional and local levels within the 2003-2020 period, along with rehabilitation and sustainable use efforts.<br/><br/>Objective 4:<br/>To empower institutional, policy and law enforcement arrangements at the national, regional, local, as well as at customary level so as to be effective and conducive for the management of biodiversity in a synergic, responsible, accountable, fair, balanced and sustainable manner.<br/><br/>The Government of Indonesia is committed to developing networks of MPAs by establishing 20 million hectares of MPAs by 2020.

		"summary": "Following participation in a regional workshop in Nadi in February 2009 to assess progress against PoWPA for Pacific Island countries, information on important marine and estuarine species and habitats was collated during a national planning workshop in June 2009 to develop marine and estuarine conservation targets for the national-scale ecological gap analysis.",
		"description": "Following participation in a regional workshop in Nadi in February 2009 to assess progress against PoWPA for Pacific Island countries, information on important marine and estuarine species and habitats was collated during a national planning workshop in June 2009 to develop marine and estuarine conservation targets for the national-scale ecological gap analysis. Invited stakeholders and experts included representatives from Fiji government, non-governmental organizations, the University of the South Pacific and private-sector. <br/><br/>The workshop findings indicated that although some diversity surveys and prioritization exercises have been performed for certain taxa (e.g. seabirds), data on aquatic habitat condition and species distributions are currently too deficient to: (a) determine quantitative targets for protection; (b) establish gaps in current aquatic conservation efforts; and (c) prioritize regions for protection to maximize biodiversity conservation. Furthermore, most currently available data is decentralized and not spatially located within a geographic information system (GIS) for ready analysis. <br/><br/>This project seeks additional funding to fulfil two main recommendations from the workshop:<br/><br/>1.\tCollate existing freshwater and marine information into a centralized, spatially referenced database;<br/>2.\tCollect new biodiversity and biogeographic information from data deficient taxa and habitats (e.g. seagrass, marine algae, marine and freshwater invertebrates, cetaceans).<br/><br/>As a supporting objective, we propose to raise the technical capacity of members of the national Protected Area Committee (PAC) in conservation planning skills to improve the quality of products resulting from the ecological gap analysis. The PAC is a multi-disciplinary and multi-sectoral technical advisory committee to the National Environment Council (NEC) who is tasked to lead on work under PoWPA. As few members have had prior training in conservation planning and GIS, we seek to build expertise through skills-development workshops.<br/><br/>Anticipated outcomes from additional funding to complete a comprehensive ecological gap analysis for Fiji include:<br/>•\tZoning scheme established for marine and coastal areas in conjunction with the Integrated Coastal Management Committee, a second technical arm of the NEC;<br/>•\tPriority areas for aquatic biodiversity protection in rivers, estuaries, and inshore and offshore waters identified across the defined zones through conservation planning tools (e.g. MARXAN software) that emphasize connectivity between terrestrial and marine systems; and<br/>•\tFeasibility assessment of scaling up biodiversity protection through the existing Fiji Locally Managed Marine Area (FLMMA) network, through which currently 3% of exposed reefs and 0.7% of submerged reefs mapped for Fiji (within traditional fishing grounds that have been legally demarcated by the Native Lands and Fisheries Commission) are protected under no-take closures;<br/><br/>There is a strong desire to build on the success of the FLMMA network given that the sustainability of aquatic resources in Fiji is increasingly threatened as a result of increased pollution and overfishing. National catch per unit effort data indicate that  greater than 70% of catch from common food fish families (snapper and emperor) are below minimum reproductive size, therefore reducing the potential for population replenishment. Of this “subsistence” catch, more than 70% is sold, thus greatly underestimating the value of the fisheries sector, which is already the third largest contributor to gross domestic product (GDP) from natural resources. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, areas with poor land management practices have recently experienced massive flooding, resulting in enormous damage to infrastructure (~FJD$300 million spent on damages from January 2009 floods) and untold impacts to freshwater, coastal and marine habitats and species. Given the risk of increased frequency of extreme climate disturbance associated with global climate change, Fiji urgently needs to develop conservation plans which include both no-take areas preserve connectivity between terrestrial and marine systems and also other types of resource management (e.g. best practices for land management) to reduce threats from multiple use zones.",

		"ecological_contribution": "The Fijian marine ecoregion lies adjacent to the global hotspot for tropical marine biodiversity and provides livelihoods for thousands of people. The diversity of freshwater and marine flora and fauna across the Fiji Islands is exceptional. Expansive coral reef habitat (almost 4% of the world’s total reef area) supports over 340 species of reef-building corals and greater than 1200 species of reef fish (including 15 known endemics to the Fiji-Tonga region). Deep passages and high current areas form important migratory passages for the 17 species of cetaceans sighted in Fijian waters, while lush seagrass beds form important fish nurseries and foods sources for 5 species of marine turtle. <br/><br/>These marine habitats are highly connected to island rivers and streams through extensive mangrove estuaries, through which >98% of the 164 species of freshwater and estuarine fish in Fiji make contact with the sea during their life cycles. The freshwater wetlands occupy up to 0.3% of Fiji’s land area most of which are peat swamps, rivers and streams and few freshwater lakes. Only few peat swamps remain undisturbed due to reclamation of peat swamps for agriculture and development. In recent years surveys and documentation of freshwater fishes and freshwater biodiversity has contributed towards better understanding of freshwater and brackish systems.<br/><br/>Almost all of these species counts, however, are likely to be underestimates of the true diversity within Fiji’s waters as many islands, regions and taxa are still unstudied. Research on Fiji’s invertebrate remains lacking and this is due in part to a focus of research on invertebrate species of agricultural importance. Furthermore, the biogeographic distributions across the 332 islands of the Fijian archipelago are unknown for most species.<br/><br/>With specific reference to marine turtles, the Fiji islands are thought to be a ‘hot spot’ in terms of feeding grounds. This has been illustrated through flipper and satellite tagging activities conducted over the past 15 years in the region, that show post-nesting turtles migrating to Fiji (Ref. Fig. 1a, 1b).",

		"description": "En novembre 2005 a eu lieu au Niger la Consultation sectorielle sur l'environnement et la lutte contre la désertification, laquelle s’est traduit par un Plan d'Action à Moyen Terme (PAMT), décliné en 14 sous-programmes, eux-mêmes rattachés aux programmes de la SDR. Parmi les objectifs retenus pour le PAMT en matière de conservation de la biodiversité on peut citer :<br/>- Créer les conditions d'une gestion durable des ressources naturelles au niveau local ; <br/>-Poursuivre et intensifier les efforts d'information et de sensibilisation des populations ; <br/>- Promouvoir la conservation in-situ et ex-situ de la diversité biologique ; <br/>- Promouvoir des mécanismes intégrés de gestion rationnelle de l'espace sylvo-pastoral ;<br/>- Promouvoir des dispositifs d'atténuation des crises environnementales ; <br/>- Encourager l'émergence et soutenir les organisations professionnelles en renforçant les capacités des organisations professionnelles. <br/><br/>Les Aires Protégées occupent une place de choix dans ce dispositif. Elles constituent un maillon important dans l’atteinte de ces objectifs. En effet les Aires Protégées sont soit précurseurs soit demandeurs des actions. Le processus de décentralisation engagé peut être la locomotive de développement des Aires Protégées par l’implication des autres acteurs étant donné que l’Etat a fait le premier pas  par la création et le transfert de certaines compétences aux communes et autres entités.<br/><br/>Par ailleurs, dans le cadre de la lutte contre la pauvreté, le Niger a voulu donner un cachet particulier au secteur rural, en élaborant suivant une approche globale, une  stratégie de développement rural (SDR) en 2003. Ce document qui est le seul cadre de référence dans le secteur rural est assorti d’un plan d’action élaboré en novembre 2006. Ce programme reste au centre des actions de la Direction des Parcs Nationaux et des Réserves (DPNR). La préservation de la biodiversité et des espaces naturels sera poursuivie à travers le renforcement du réseau d’Aires Protégées, conservation in situ et ex situ des ressources génétiques. La réintroduction de certaines espèces sauvages disparues et la restauration de certains milieux dégradés constituant l’habitat de la faune et de la flore permettront de préserver à long terme la biodiversité du Niger. La prise de conscience par l’ensemble des acteurs des évolutions environnementales sera développée. La DPN/R Développera un volet d’Information Education et Communication (IEC) en mesure de répondre aux besoins du public. <br/>Dans son programme N° 10 consacré à la protection de l’environnement, et son objectif spécifique n°3 : la conservation in-situ et ex-situ de la biodiversité, le plan d’action de la SDR prévoit une place de choix à la gestion des Aires Protégés.  En effet, sur le plan des ressources fauniques, on estime que les effectifs de la faune sauvage ont beaucoup diminué au cours des trente dernières années, du fait de la diminution de la superficie des Aires Protégées, la pression démographique, les feux de brousse, les changements climatiques, le pâturage illégal et le braconnage.  Plusieurs espèces de mammifères sont menacées d'extinction comme l'Addax (Addax nasomaculatus), le Mouflon à manchette (Ammontragus lervia), le Lamantin (Trichechus senegalensis), l'Autruche (Struthio camelus camelus) et la Girafe (Girafa cameleopardis peralta) dont le Niger conserve les derniers spécimens Ouest -africains, etc. Les changements climatiques rendent les Aires Protégées vulnérables et ont un impact sur la redistribution et la dynamique des animaux. C’est pour permettre une meilleure répartition des animaux et atténuer les impacts des changements climatiques sur la faune sauvage que le Niger a initié la connectivité entre certaines de ces aires protégées. Les effets des changements climatiques sur les Aires Protégées doivent être connus afin de les intégrer dans les plans d’aménagement et  de gestion.<br/><br/>C’est  ainsi que, conscient de la situation préoccupante  de la faune du Niger et  dans le souci de la mise en œuvre du programme de travail sur les Aires Protégées, le Niger à retenu dans ce plan comme priorité : le renforcement des capacités de gestion des Aires Protégées nationales et transfrontalières. C’est ainsi qu’actuellement environ 8,5 millions d’ha (soient 6,6% du territoire national) sont érigée en Aires Protégées et dédiés à la conservation de la biodiversité. Pour être en conformité avec les dispositions des articles 7, 8, 10, 11 et 14 de la convention sur la diversité biologique, le Niger s’est engagé à gérer de manière écologiquement durable, les Aires Protégées déjà crées et à développer un plan de classement de nouveaux sites de : Termit-Tin Toumma, Tadress, Azawak, Sirba et le sanctuaire des hippopotames à Ayorou, en vue d’atteindre les Objectifs du Millenium pour le Développement (OMD), à savoir  de 12% du territoire national érigé en Aires Protégées. Avec le classement de la réserve de Termit-Tin Toumma (plus de 10 millions d’ha), dont le processus est dans sa dernière phase, plus de 12% de la superficie du Niger serait dédiée aux Aires Protégées. <br/>Dans le cadre de la mise en œuvre  de la section Aires protégées du plan d’action de la SDR et du programme de travail sur les Aires Protégées et tenant compte de ses moyens limités, le Niger est convaincu qu’un travail préalable est nécessaire afin de déterminer les actions prioritaires à mener. L’analyse des écarts est un outil indispensable permettant de faire la situation de mise en œuvre des activités prioritaires pour le Niger sur la base du programme de travail, notamment ce qui est fait, ce qui reste à faire, les moyens disponibles au niveau national pour continuer les actions, le gaps financier, humains et matériels à solliciter pour atteindre les objectifs  fixés. Un accent particulier sera mis sur l’analyse des effets des changements climatiques et les mesures d’atténuation et d’adaptation à  y prévoir.<br/> A cet effet, le Point Focal National (PFN) de la Convention sur la Diversité Biologique du Niger en rapport avec la Direction des Parcs Nationaux et des Réserves a l’honneur de soumettre cette requête de financement d’une étude sur le Gap analysis.",

		"description": "Papua New Guinea in Context. PNG is home to one of just four large, intact tropical forest wilderness areas remaining on Earth, with over 30 million hectares of old growth forests. An astounding 50 percent of PNG’s plants (approximately 15,000 species in total) are endemic. <br/><br/>This extraordinary resource is threatened primarily by large-scale and destructive industrial practice, especially through unregulated, clear-fell logging of lowland forest and related conversion of forest areas to oil palm plantation. However, it is acknowledged that forest is also being lost through pressures caused by a growing population, a rapid society-wide shift from subsistence to a cash economy, and mounting pressures to meet education, health, food, and other development needs. <br/><br/>In PNG, private landowners control 97 percent of the land in traditional clan-based ownership. Thus, conventional, ‘Northern’ approaches to conservation—focused around large, state-managed protected areas— have very limited application in PNG. These land tenure conditions, combined with the lack of a strong central government, leave forest, mangrove and coral reefs protection largely in the hands of landowners with small holdings. To be effective, efforts to support conservation initiatives in PNG must focus at the landowner level. <br/><br/>Regrettably, landowners have not been empowered to lead conservation efforts in PNG. Lacking adequate tools, capacity, and awareness, landowners have been unable to redress these problems, and have generally regarded conservation and sustainable development as a low priority. Because land is held under customary ownership, there are additional challenges in securing the long-term, legal protection of PNG’s incredibly important natural areas. Mama Graun was created to address this issue of empowerment of local resource owners to manage critical protected areas in PNG.<br/><br/> This background of the PNG context is the very reason why most attempt to develop conservation areas has failed in the last 30 years in PNG as expectations from the targeted communities with a western approach raised rapidly high expectation, communities seeing all the material used by external organization (4X4, boats, diving gears, etc) and none of this for them. This created conflicts and make work impossible and organization were throw out or banned from the area. Mama Graun has learned from these experiences and foremost is a local organization that has stringent rules and process to give out grant or for groups to access its money. <br/><br/>In developing this project, Mama Graun has been very careful of avoiding the “cargo cult” mentality that prevails in many communities throughout PNG where communities expect funding and goods to be delivered rather then, having the communities involved in the decision making and ensuring delivery of services. The delivery of these incentives will be carefully designed to integrate the community development process, the increase of business opportunities and capacities with each incentive. Each of these incentives will be assessed with the perspective of the recurrent cost that will be needed to secure the long term conservation agreement. <br/><br/>Mama Graun is acutely aware that the propose incentives need to be continued beyond the life of this Lifeweb proposal and consequently has initiated the creation of a Stewardship Endowment fund to address the long term recurrent cost of managing protected areas and in the context of PNG, continue to provide incentives to communities for their conservation work on their land that has been declared with their consent Protected Areas.",

Included in the PNG protected area list are wildlife management area (WMA) which seeks to conserve biological diversity by involving local landowners. Most of the existing protected areas are small in size and were created to protect specific resource and or cultural sites and lack any ecosystems connectivity or sustainability or ecosystems representation of the country. <br/><br/>In this project Mama Graun effort to support the larger protected areas such as Maza, Kamiali, Pirung and Crater Mountain is to ensure that there is ecosystems viability and connectivity. Further as you can see from the map provided, our efforts attempt to ensure that areas Mama Graun supports are representative of the country’s rich biodiversity. <br/><br/>The new areas to be supported by this project, not only increases the protected areas coverage for PNG, it also strengthens the local community efforts that have already entered into agreements for smaller protected areas as WMAs. The expansion to large areas ensures ecosystems connectivity and makes smaller existing PAs within larger PAs more sustainable. Of the new areas targeted: Kikori Basin, Nakanai Range, Collingwood Bay and Managalas Plateau have been nominated by PNG government for World Heritage listing, indicating their biodiversity and cultural values to the country. The work under this project will contribute greatly to advance the management and knowledge base needed to make this nomination a reality. Further these are areas nominated as priority for conservation in the 1990s Conservation Needs Assessment and more recently WWFs Ecoregions and TNCs seascapes and landscapes and further reinforced in the country’s NBSAP. <br/><br/>Current Mama Graun conservation program is working towards developing a functioning system of PNG protected areas by taking a lead in systematic capacity building at community level and supporting management planning in all the priority PAs. This is a major contribution to the governments effort to rejuvenate and expand the protected areas in the country.",

All elements of this proposal are to empower land, sea and resources users to manage conservation areas on the long term. Mama Graun as already started to address the concept of incentives to lock long term conservation in selected areas. As mentioned above, Mama Graun concept is to have the whole community to benefit from incentives instead of Individual. Also, in the PNG context, woman generally do not participate in the traditional decision making process. However, by including the Church as a main partner, it change the dynamics of women’s participation as women church groups are well mobilized. Mama Graun will support the integration of environmental issues to be part of women’s church work. In this way women can also have an impact of the decision making on environmental issues. <br/><br/>This action will support national, provincial and local level governments agencies, resource managers, and communities to work together to make conservation of irreplaceable biodiversity will be secured for the long term. The Mama Graun community-based management approach utilized involves multiple stakeholders in participatory, decision-making processes. This approach secures local management of protected areas, helping to ensure greater long-term sustainability and more equitable sharing of benefits. Although road access, weather condition, remoteness and capacity are a challenge to effectively managing some of these 21 selected areas, the provision of additional financial and human resources will greatly change the conservation dynamic in PNG were conservation has been so neglected for so many years. This program will ensure through Mama Graun that the selected Conservation Areas have the resources they need to manage appropriately their conservation areas, conduct monitoring and enforcement. <br/><br/>With this project Mama Graun will offer to all stakeholders the chance to work together, national, provincial and local agencies to work collaboratively with NGO, private sector and communities to achieve the vision of a sustained bounty of life that nourish the communities and the whole nation.",

		"description": "The Levanga Conservancy, a 13 035 hectare wildlife ranch created in the 1970s, is located in South East (SE) lowveld of Zimbabwe and is part of the 350 000 hectares  Save Valley Conservancy (SVC) in Chiredzi district in  Masvingo province. The SVC is the world’s largest privately owned wildlife reserve and is home to the big five (elephant, lion, buffalo, black rhino and leopard) and small five (suni, steenbok, grysbok, klipspringer and duiker) (Herald Sept, 1997). It is endowed with a diversity of forest resources including endangered plant species such as the Sabi star (Adenium obesum).  Among the other species present are: 250 leopard, 500 klipspringer, 200 nyala, 6 white rhino and 150 sable (Goodwin, 1997) and approximately 400 species of birds. <br/>Levanga Conservancy and the SVC form components of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park (GLTP) Conservation Area (CA). The GLTP is the world’s largest tract of land in which animals can live freely and covers an area of 35,000 km2 linking the Gonarenzou National Park in Zimbabwe to Mozambique’s Limpopo National Park, and  to South Africa’s Kruger National Park . The Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park Conservation Area (GLTPCA) covers 100 000 km2 in total. The GLTPCA initiative faces the challenge of linking the strategies of the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) and Millennium Development Goals on conservation and socio-economic wellbeing of the 120 000 local people settled in and around the area.  These communities have, for decades, managed and derived benefits from the wildlife, plant and water resources in this area (Metcalfe, 2003).  Over the last three decades, communities surrounding SVC and Levanga have not benefited from the sustainable use of their resources. The need for communities to benefit from protected areas (PAs) in the GLTPCA should be addressed as a matter of urgency for the initiative to be a true success. Denying local residents their rights to benefit from resources found on lands they were once settled has negative implications for the conservation of biological resources. Why should PAs, with much potential to generate wealth, be surrounded by a sea of poverty? <br/><br/>This proposed initiative is a necessary, timely and strategic starting point towards addressing the people-park conflict in Zimbabwe’s south east lowveld.  The Government of Zimbabwe recognises that local communities who are neighbours to protected areas and who bear the cost of living with wild animals need to get clear benefits to make conservation at the local level relevant.  It has therefore designed a programme through which members of the indigenous business local community  are awarded 25 year lease agreements for a conservancy or wildlife ranch to enable them to set up partnerships with the local community, private sector and other stakeholders in both biodiversity conservation and the tourism development business. The Levanga conservancy is an example of such an initiative where the Chibememe, local entrepreneurs and private sector are jointly working on biodiversity conservation, tourism development and climate change mitigation for the improvement of local livelihoods. <br/><br/>Community members are granted rights to occupy the land and sustainably manage the wildlife. It thus empowers members of the community with the exclusive rights to conduct hunting safaris, game-viewing, photographic safaris and hunt wild animals and to further process, sell and dispose of the products derived from these animals. The Levanga shall only be used for wildlife production, operating hunting safaris, operating game viewing and photographic safaris.<br/><br/>A number of major threats to the Levanga Conservancy have been documented:<br/>• Overall impoverishment of the ecology of the PA through encroachment, grazing, persistent poaching and deforestation, and veld fires.<br/>• Major land conversion and degradation through removal of vegetation.<br/>• Isolation of the Conservancy through major conversion of adjacent communal lands to crop farming.<br/>• Rural poverty and landlessness.<br/>• Encroachment by invasive species, in particular, Lantana camara.<br/>• Lack of capacity and resources, including: inadequate institutional capacity and infrastructure, lack of community involvement and participation, and lack of agreements about land and resource use adjacent to the conservancy.<br/><br/>Source of Threats<br/>• Climate change.<br/>• Unsustainable high rate of human population growth and natural resource consumption.<br/>• Economic systems and policies that fail to value the environment and its resources.<br/>• Inequity in the ownership, management, and flow of benefits from both the use and conservation of biodiversity resources.<br/>• Legal and institutional systems that promote unsustainable exploitation.<br/>• Loss of cultural connections between people and the land.<br/><br/>The use of fire claims around 145 000 hectares of land per year, while unsustainable farming practices claim from between 70 000 to 100 000 hectares of woodland and forests in Zimbabwe annually (GEFSGP Strategy document, 1994). This has contributed to the siltation of the Save International River where 50 to 80 tons of soil per year per hectare is deposited in the river, threatening livestock and aquatic life (Journal for the Natural Resources Board and the Department of Natural Resources (DNR), 1998).<br/><br/>The intervention is need and demand driven. Local communities are at the centre lobbying for the recognition and implementation of the “democracy principle” in Transboundary Natural Resource Management (TBNRM) initiatives in the region. It enables rural communities to propose and support their own agenda  and to participate  in and benefit  from the management of biodiversity resources. It builds their capacity to access information, and maintain their access and benefit from natural resources that historically supported their livelihoods. It takes on board local communities who are often considered “the forgotten pieces of the TFCA jigsaw puzzle.”   <br/><br/>Organizational Background and capacity<br/>Chibememe Earth Healing Association (CHIEHA) is a community based conservation and development organization established in 1998 in rural South Eastern in Masvingo province in Zimbabwe. It is a legally constituted community conservation Trust (Deed Registration Number MA 722/2005).CHIEHA is a 2001 Natural Resources Board (NRB) Conservation Competition  Prize winner  and a  2004 UNDP Equator Initiative Prize Finalist recognized for its outstanding effort in contributing to simultaneously conserving biodiversity and reducing poverty through its community conservation and development initiatives. Available at the following link: http://www.undp.org/equatorinitiative/secondary/2004-finalists.htm. CHIEHA is a member of the African region (Southern Africa sub region) International Indigenous Forum on Biodiversity (IIFB) and the Germany-Dutch Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) Capacity building Initiative for Africa. CHIEHA actively participate in the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) and Article 8(j) and Related Provisions processes.<br/><br/>Furthermore, over the years, CHIEHA has organized and led a number of environmental awareness programmes and activities, both nationally and regionally, to promote biodiversity conservation and the sharing of benefits in PAs. Among the activities and programmes include:<br/><br/>•the 2003 Community Benefits Beyond Boundaries Cycle ride in conjunction with the Fifth World Parks Congress that saw a group of Southern African Development Community (SADC) rural community representatives cycling around the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park (GLTP) (Zimbabwe, Mozambique and South Africa) to Durban raising environmental awareness to rural communities and other stakeholders in the region and lobby policy makers to develop policies that promote Indigenous and Local Communities’ (ILCs) participation in the GLTP. (http://www.undp.org/equatorinitiative/secondary/events/WPC-     CommunityPark-LimpopoBasinCyclistsDeclaration.htm).<br/><br/>•the 2000 Community ride to Save the Environment in conjunction with the Bambanani Tose ride and the1999 Millennium Environmental Community Bicycle ride that saw Chibememe village and CHIEHA  community members cycling around the SE Lowveld raising environmental awareness to local communities in and around the Save Valley and Malilangwe conservancies and surrounding communal areas.<br/>Africa 2000 Network (A2N) and Fos Belgium supported livelihood and sustainable agriculture project. In the same vein  CHIEHA got financial and technical support to implement other conservation and livelihood from international organizations such as the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), the United Nations Development Programme Global Environment Facility Small Grants Programme (UNDPGEFSGP), the French-supported Assistance for Underprivileged Populations (AURP), the UNDP Equator Initiative, and the Austrian-supported former OED and HorizonT3000, among others.",

		"ecological_contribution": "Levanga conservancy is part of the SVC, a rhino conservancy designated by the Parks and Wildlife Authority in the early 1990s. It is currently a habitat for more than 70 endangered black rhinoceros. It is also home to more than 92 endangered painted wild dogs. The SVC contributed to the recovery of  the wild dog population in Zimbabwe that had fallen from 3000 dogs in the late 1950s to only 8 dogs in 1995 (Rasmussen 1996). As part of SVC, Levanga encompasses the habitats of several notable rare species including the nyala and grysbok. It is also home to the endemic small bodied and large tasked elephant bulls, believed to be found nowhere else in Southern Africa except in Gonarezhou National Park (Goodwin, 1997) to which it is adjacent. <br/><br/>The Levanga Conservancy comprises savannah forest vegetation, coupled with riparian vegetation and it borders on forested conservancy land, highly degraded communal land. The Save international river constitutes its eastern boundary while Sangwe communal Lands, the Humani and Senuko conservancies form its southern, northern and western boundaries, respectively. The Save river and its tributaries (the Runde and Mwenezi) are habitats for 50 fish species which include African Lungfish, the Zambezi shark and the small-toothed sawfish (Goodwin, 1997). These species are rare and found nowhere else in Zimbabwe, with the exception of the lowveld (the S E Lowveld and the Zambezi valley).<br/><br/> In addition to Levanga’s role in conserving wildlife and aquatic resources, it protects the watershed and catchment of the Save international river and thus guarantees the supply of water to the nearby populations in Zimbabwe and Mozambique. This water supply is essential to Zimbabwe’s lowveld cotton and sugar estates as well as to the water supply in areas further downstream. This fresh water system provides livelihoods for local communities who use it for agriculture and domestic purposes. Levanga is also endowed with sites of historical and cultural significance to the surrounding Chibememe, Gudo and Sangwe communities among which include the Dombo hill which is the historical royal burial shrine of the traditional Gudo chieftainship and the Sadzive sacred pools which the Gudo community utilise to perform special cultural rituals and activities. Culturally significant areas surrounding Levanga also include the Zivembava Island Forest in Save River, Chiso Sacred Pool and the Ndongo ruins. These areas are, in terms of the CBD Article 8 (j) and 10 (c), critical for the cultural and livelihood development of the local communities. The project will ensure that cultural and ecological linkages are created through capacity development, restoration of the local peoples’ pride and confidence in their local culture. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the natural forests in Levanga and the surrounding areas help to reduce the extremes of water flow and soil erosion and hence play a part in flood control in the lower Save river course. Levanga as part of the SVC and a network of private and state PAs in the south east lowveld of Zimbabwe, measuring a total of approximately one million hectares (Chiredzi river 110 000 ha, Save Valley 350 000 ha, Malilangwe 40 000 ha and Gonarezhou National Park 500 000 ha) has forests and water systems that play critical roles in mitigating the impact of climate change. Forest and water bodies are essential as carbon reservoirs or as sinks that are vital for enhancing carbon sequestration and thus contributing to global efforts to address anthropogenic climate change. The project will therefore contribute to mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate change through managing forest and woodland resources in and around the Levanga conservancy.<br/><br/>Some of the critical ecosystem processes being driven by the combined activities of the many plant and animal species found in the Levanga Conservancy and surrounding areas include: supporting plant regeneration (pollinators, seed disperse and seed predators), food webs and plant diversity. The project is expected to promote ecological linkages between private wildlife conservancies, surrounding communal lands, and state protected areas and in the process, enhance food webs and plant regeneration.  This will also bolster plant and wildlife diversity through rehabilitating, restoring, and restocking of wildlife.",

The local community will be responsible for the day to day implementation of the project activities and especially those activities that are expected to he undertaken on communal land: for example, the construction of the agro-processing and craft centre. The majority of the staff expected to work in Levanga conservancy will be recruited from the Gudo and Chibememe communities and thus enabling them to effectively participate in the management of the Conservancy. The CHIEHA community will benefit from the wildlife in the Conservancy as they will be able to bring their tourists to observe and photograph game in the conservancy and thus in the process derive benefits from the wildlife business.<br/><br/>The project will put in place mechanisms to support a steady flow of information among the communities that are affected by the GLTP/TFCA initiative and thus allowing them to lobby for their benefits. The project will strengthen the capacities of rural communities through existing community-based institutional mechanisms and groups. This will help the communities to tap the economic development opportunities offered by the initiative. The proposed activities will give communities the following advantages or benefits: <br/><br/>a) Building the capacity of the communities to engage other stakeholders; <br/>b) Generating information and facilitating sharing of knowledge among the communities;<br/>c) Enabling community members to enter formal employment and negotiations for benefit sharing; <br/>d) Strengthen community institutions through leadership development and capacity building of staff; <br/>e) Improving the livelihoods of the communities.<br/><br/>Once the project is successfully funded, the community will be involved in designing a community action plan which will be used during project implementation. This will be done through the use of participatory methodologies with participants drawn from CHIEHA, Chibememe Village, Levanga Conservancy representatives, neighbouring villages, and other stakeholders.<br/><br/>In order to ensure that the community actively participate in CHIEHA initiated community based environmental awareness and livelihoods programmes: for example, the heritage festivals, community drama and traditional dance groups and community bike rides. These activities have been able to encourage all community members to participate in the programme and thus enhancing the sense of ownership. Levanga Conservancy and CHIEHA shall work with a clear understanding that the, “the community should play a central role in their area and should be active participants and direct beneficiaries of the project”.",

		"financial_sustainability": "The project is expected to last beyond the initial thee years that it will be receiving the requested support. A number of factors will make this initiative financially sustainable. First, the interest shown by the different stakeholders and the fact that some government agencies and NGOs are already engaged in a number of activities in the Transfrontier Frontier Conservation Areas (TFCAs) constitute positive indicators for project sustainability. The Global Environment Facility Small Grants (GEFSGP) have over the past decade supported conservation and community based tourism around state protected areas and conservancies in the GLTP-TFCA. Both CESVI (an Italian Environmental Organisation) and SAFIRE have already taken steps to promote tourism development in the TFCAs, in the Chiredzi district. These activities and the interest shown by the private sector lay the foundation for sustainable development. Second, the activities being proposed address the livelihood needs of the community groups. This advantage is further strengthened by the fact that the project is promoting community ownership of the proposed infrastructure.  Third, some of the proposed activities are intended to build on existing initiatives by the community. For example, CHIEHA already has an information centre, which will be furnished under the proposed project. Fourth, the scope and character of the GLTP initiative is an important driver for regional socio-economic development.     <br/><br/>The project endeavors to help spread conservation benefits to local communities around the Levanga Conservancy and the GLTP area through access and equitable sharing of economic benefits arising from the commercialization of biological resources and, in particular, wildlife. The benefits arising from Safari hunting, game viewing and other non-consumptive and consumptive tourism ventures will be directed towards the development of the initiative. This will also be ploughed back into local communities and thus multiply and extend the impact of the project. It is expected that benefits arising from the project will be invested into other community projects, which will further ensure the sustainability of the whole project. The following example is the projected expenditure and revenue expected from a single business hunt in a conservancy like Levanga; <br/><br/>A typical hunting bag would comprise:<br/>Estimated Revenues from the Safari<br/><br/>Trophy fees payable by client to <br/>•\tOne buffalo male\t\t\t\t    US$2 000<br/>•\tOne leopard male\t\t\t\t    US$3 250<br/>•\tOne waterbuck male\t\t\t            US$1 500<br/>•\tOne kudu male\t\t\t\t            US$850<br/>•\tThree impala males\t\t\t            US$200 each<br/>•\tTwo grysbok\t\t\t\t            US$150 each<br/>•\tTwo warthog \t\t\t\t            US$350 each<br/><br/>•\tTherefore the client would pay a total of  US$9 200 trophy fees<br/>•\tSuch a bag-package would attract a daily rate of US$850 per day for 14 days<br/>•\tGuests/non-hunting clients will pay US$150 per day for the duration of the hunt<br/>•\tTherefore the total revenue to be earned is US$21 100<br/><br/>Estimated expenses for running the safari:<br/>•\tProfessional hunter fees at US$200 per day for 14 days = US$2 800<br/>•\tRunning cost, food, beverage, fuel etc. at US$120 per day for 14 days = US$1680<br/>•\tIncidental cost at US$300 for 14 days <br/>•\tTotal expenses = US$4 780<br/><br/>Profits<br/>Profit to the operator = US$21 100 – US$4 780 = US$16 320 (Parks &Wildlife Authority – Commercial Services 2009).<br/> <br/>Once wildlife population is fully established and sustainable quotas are set, Levanga Conservancy will be able to contribute revenue exceeding   US$ 94 000 annually from sixteen selected species by the third year of project implementation (see table 2 Annex 1). To ensure sustainability off-take will be taken from base population above the  maximum sustainable yield (or economic carrying capacity) which for long lived species (Elephant) is 80% of ecological carrying capacity (K), 60% of ecological K for medium lived species (Kudu, Zebra) and at 50% for short lived species (impala, warthog ). The two by six bed lodge with an assumed occupancy rate of 10% will contribute US$ 21 600 to the system. The revenue will be ploughed back into the project and thus ensuring its sustainability. Furthermore the capacity of the community will be developed through training and thus results in project sustainability.<br/>The project will be co financed by the following organisations: a). CHIEHA- US$ 20 000 -Community office space and labour, b). Africa 2000 Network –US$12 000 -Supporting conservation agriculture and training in Participatory Development Management (PDM).  c)Levanga conservancy -  US$ 3 493 380 in form of 13 035 hectares of land for biodiversity conservation and tourism development at a conservative unstocked land market value of US$268 per hectare (Easton 2004), d) Parks and Wildlife Authority and MET- US$9 000 in form of technical expertise. Total contribution by beneficiaries and partners is US$3 534380. This will be in form of expertise, cash, kind and assets.",

		"alignment": "The project endeavours to achieve the goal and objectives of the National Biodiversity Conservation Strategy and Management Framework (1997) as articulated in the Biodiversity Conservation Plan.  Its main goal is to promote the conservation of biodiversity, sustainable use of natural resources and the equitable sharing of benefits from their utilisation). The key strategies relevant to this project, outlined in both the Zimbabwe Biodiversity Conservation Management Framework (1997) and the Zimbabwe National Sustainable Development Strategies (2004), are as follows: <br/>• Promote sustainable harvesting of natural forests; ensure that conservation objectives are addressed in harvesting operations.<br/>• Promote management of private lands to conserve biodiversity.<br/>• Promote the effective management and development of transfrontier parks and conservation areas.<br/>• Promote appropriate tourism to sites rich in biodiversity; build public information about biodiversity into tourism.<br/>• Promote management and rehabilitation of catchment areas.<br/>• Promote participatory approaches to development  and management especially in CBNRM.<br/>• Provision of recreation facilities in disadvantaged areas.<br/>• Provision of information facilities to all remote areas and at local level.<br/>• Provide information and empower communities to own means of production.<br/>• Facilitate the provision and management of resources to capacitate institutions and communities through activities such as the establishment of  new and reviving existing sustainable ecotourism projects<br/>• Improve market access for agriculture and natural resources<br/><br/>TFCAs in Zimbabwe cover commercial farming areas, conservancies (e.g. the Save Valley Conservancy) communal lands (e.g. Sangwe) and resettlement areas. More than 125 000 rural people are directly and indirectly affected by the GLTP and need to be actively involved in the management of biodiversity in the TFCAs. The Chibememe community is already organized and have started working on biodiversity conservation, poverty reduction, climate change mitigation, land degradation, and protection of the Save international river. However, there is need for proper coordination of these efforts; this will increase opportunities and impacts from the local to global scales.  This can be achieved through resource availability. <br/><br/>The project is in line with the Establishment of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park Treaty (2002)  objectives on ecosystem  management and multi-stakeholder  collaboration and assists  Zimbabwe in implementing Articles  8 (85%) , 8(j) (65%), 10 (c) (60%) and  15 (75) of the Convention on Biodiversity  (CBD) on in-situ conservation (wildlife), Indigenous Knowledge (IKS) , Traditional resource use  and equitable Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS)  themes respectively.<br/><br/>Co-management and ABS arrangements on protected area resources are a critical aspect of Community Based Natural Resources Management (CBNRM) in Zimbabwe. This has been achieved through the CAMPFIRE programme and some areas in south east lowveld have been managed through CAMPFIRE. However, devolution of authority and responsibilities is limited, and benefits to the communities are limited as the programme is managed at Rural District Council (RDC) level. Currently the Government of Zimbabwe is taking deliberate action to increase the involvement of communities in the active and effective management of protected areas including conservancies and national parks through policy and legal reforms, including, for example, the Environmental Management Act, the Wildlife Based Land Reform Policy, and the National Environmental Policy and strategies. Three members from the Gudo and Chibememe community have, through a lease, been granted the following rights: (a) Right to hunt and occupy land in Chiredzi District marked as Levanga Conservancy, (b) Exclusive right to conduct hunting safaris (c) Game-viewing (d) Photographic safaris and (e) Hunt wild animals within the conservancy (i) process (ii) sell (iii) dispose of the products of such animals. This is also in line with the Zimbabwe National Sustainable Development Strategies (2004) among whose major strategy for achieving sustainable development is empowering communities to own means of production through ensuring that security of tenure has been provided through long term leases [Ministry of Environment and Tourism  2004].The project is in line with both the Zimbabwe National Environmental Policy and Strategies 2009 and the Wildlife Based land Reform Policy which seeks to achieve an equitable ownership of wildlife resources by benefiting  “rural and landless people willing to engage in wildlife production and those who reside adjacent to wildlife” and “those who have the means (skills and resources) and wish to enter and remain in the sector” (.http://www.un.org/Pubs/chronicle/2005/issue4/0405p53.html).<br/><br/>The GEF-SGP in Zimbabwe has been working since 1998 and is continuing to work with communities. GEFSGP is promoting networking among communities in the region beyond the boundaries of Zimbabwe. It supported the 2003 Chibememe community’s “Benefits Beyond the Boundaries” cycle ride initiative in conjunction with the Fifth World Parks Congress (WPC) held in Durban South Africa and also supported the establishment of the CHIEHA environmental information centre. This is in line with the Zimbabwe National Sustainable Development Strategies 2004 and Zimbabwe National Response to the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (JPI) which  set as a strategy the provision of information that empower communities to own means of production through setting up of information centres at grassroots levels requiring that districts to have information centres at ward level by 2009. It also addresses the Government’s HIV/AIDs policy as it benefits female and child headed families which are a result of the effects of HIV/AIDs.<br/><br/>The project is in line with the Zimbabwe National Sustainable Development Strategies and Johannesburg Plan of Implementation which details the environmental and economic priorities of Zimbabwe.  The  project addresses the following national priorities issues as provided for in the Zimbabwe National Sustainable Development Strategy document;<br/><br/>Environmental <br/>• Protection and sustainable management  and utilization of  natural resources for economic  and social development<br/>• Promote catchment area management ,landcare principles  and rehabilitation<br/>• Undertake Community Based Natural Resources Management (CBNRM) initiatives at community , district  and provincial level<br/>• Promotion of alternative energy sources and promoting energy efficiency.<br/>• Monitoring and sustainable utilisation and management of natural resources<br/>• Develop affordable sources of renewable energy and improve access<br/>• Establishment of income- generating activities especially ecotourism<br/><br/>Economic<br/>• Reducing poverty by promoting economic growth<br/>• Promote sustainable utilisation of natural resources for commercial gain.<br/>• Promote Tourism, entrepreneurship and small enterprises<br/>• Decentralise and implement economic and institutional policy framework to sub national level.<br/>• Enhance local institutions’ financial base and management to enable them to support  various projects and programmes<br/>• Promoting self-reliance and community-based initiatives<br/>• Promoting equitable distribution of income and other forms of wealth, e.g., land and minerals.<br/><br/>Unique <br/>• Promotion of Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park and Transfrontier  Conservation Area<br/>• Limpopo spatial development initiative<br/>• Promotion of viability in cultural industry and sustainable resource use<br/>• Use of CBNRM strategies to ensure sustainable management and utilisation of indigenous fruit trees<br/>• Development of tourism facilities.<br/>• Promote community involvement in horticulture production<br/>• Promotion of food security and agro-processing industries.<br/>• Combating major killer diseases- (HIV/AIDs, TB, malaria and cholera)<br/><br/>The project also hinges on the objectives of Government’s Environmental policy as outlined in the “Strategic Directions”-MET1998.  The initiative is an effort to contribute towards achieving these objectives which state that:<br/>•\tRate of afforestation be increased to 10% annually with effect from 1999<br/>•\tDegradation of banks be reduced by the end of 2003<br/>•\tEnsure that timber poaching be reduced by 50% by end of 2003.<br/>The project will also contribute to achieving the government’s gender policy by creating an enabling environment for women, man and youth to actively and effectively to participate in the decision making process as regards project design, implementation and monitoring processes. In addition, the relationship of CHIEHA with Levanga and other stakeholders is pursuant to the Earth Summit-Rio Declaration principle 22 which Zimbabwe is a signatory. It states that ‘indigenous people and their communities have a vital role in environmental management and development because of their knowledge and traditional practices. States should recognise and duly support their identity, culture and interests and enable their effective participation in the achievement of sustainable development’. Therefore this initiative has taken into consideration the government policy together with the global conventions which Zimbabwe is a signatory for example the CBD, the Rio declaration, Establishment of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park Treaty (2002) and the Climate change convention and JPI  among others.",

		"description": "Protected areas are an essential part of the global response to climate change because they help to address the root cause of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In the Eastern Caribbean, marine ecosystems are the most effective carbon sinks. Protected areas also help small islands cope with climate change impacts by maintaining essential services upon which people depend. <br/><br/>The value of protected areas for climate change adaptation has not been specifically quantified for the Eastern Caribbean. The Economic Valuation of Coral Reefs in the Caribbean project led by the World Resources Institute found that in 2006 for St. Lucia alone coral reefs were worth more than US$28 million per annum. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) provide for long-term sustainability of fish stocks, thus supporting the livelihoods of the regions’ fishers. According to the World Resources Institute study, annual direct economic impact of coral reef associated fisheries is estimated at US$0.4–0.7 million for St. Lucia. <br/><br/>The global importance of marine and coastal protected areas for climate change adaptation is discussed in the recent comprehensive document Natural Solutions: Protected areas helping people cope with climate change, (2009, IUCN-WCPA, The Nature Conservancy, UNDP, Wildlife Conservation Society, The World Bank and WWF). “Coastal and marine areas store huge amounts of carbon, particularly in coastal zones where capture is equivalent to 0.2 Gt/year. Salt marshes, mangroves and sea grass beds all have important potential to sequester carbon.” These systems are under great threat in the region and must be protected and restored. The most effective means to ensure this is through an integrated and functioning system of protected areas.<br/><br/>The Eastern Caribbean region, which covers 4.31 million km2 of land and sea and is home to close to 600,000 people, represents one of the world’s most complex mosaics of marine freshwater and terrestrial habitats, and contains the greatest concentration of rare and endemic marine species in the Western Hemisphere. This rich biodiversity, which is partly due to its isolation within the Caribbean Sea, has resulted in relatively high rates of national and regional endemism. A survey of the world’s biodiversity hotspots identified the Caribbean as the fifth ranking “hotspot” and one of the highest priorities in any global strategy for biodiversity conservation and sustainable management (FAA 118/119 Tropical Forests and Biodiversity Assessment, 2008).<br/><br/>The increased use of marginal farmland is straining the islands’ agricultural base. Agri-chemicals are impacting water quality. Forested lands continue to be cleared, causing severe environmental problems. Fragile coral reef habitats are experiencing drastic declines in reef fish, caused in large part by overfishing. On islands like Saint Vincent, Saint Lucia and Antigua, water rationing is commonplace during much of the year, threatening the islands’ unique biological resources. Closely tied to the environmental challenges, these island nations are experiencing population growth, often localized around coast lines, further increasing risks of ecological and economic collapse. The complex situation in the Eastern Caribbean is compounded by the impact of population growth on environmental degradation. High fertility rates coupled with small land areas, limited economic opportunities, fragile island ecosystems, and cultural barriers could predict a grim future for biodiversity conservation and quality of life. And still the conservation movement within the Eastern Caribbean continues to struggle with developing sustainable strategies for affecting knowledge, attitudes and behaviours of the majority of constituents. <br/>system of protected areas.<br/><br/>The Eastern Caribbean region, which covers 4.31 million km2 of land and sea and is home to close to 600,000 people, represents one of the world’s most complex mosaics of marine freshwater and terrestrial habitats, and contains the greatest concentration of rare and endemic marine species in the Western Hemisphere.

Closely tied to the environmental challenges, these island nations are experiencing population growth, often localized around coast lines, further increasing risks of ecological and economic collapse. The complex situation in the Eastern Caribbean is compounded by the impact of population growth on environmental degradation. High fertility rates coupled with small land areas, limited economic opportunities, fragile island ecosystems, and cultural barriers could predict a grim future for biodiversity conservation and quality of life. And still the conservation movement within the Eastern Caribbean continues to struggle with developing sustainable strategies for affecting knowledge, attitudes and behaviours of the majority of constituents.",

		"ecological_contribution": "There is dire need for accelerating adaptive measures that can reduce small island countries’ vulnerability to the effects of climate change and help communities cope with the changes that are already taking place. These measures must be presented in a way that is intelligible and appealing to the average person as individual actions, when taken collectively, contribute directly to achieving community goals of enhanced waste management, healthier forests and fisheries, and improved water supplies. In most of the Eastern Caribbean States, more than 50% of the population resides within two kilometres of the coast.<br/>The Secretariat of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) has taken a leadership role on this issue. The OECS states “there is a strong need to increase awareness of the impact of climate change in the region through the conduct of research, through partnership with the private and public sectors and through an aggressive awareness campaign that targets the general population.” To achieve this, the nine member states of the OECS have launched My Island – My Community as a public awareness and behaviourchange strategy for the Eastern Caribbean to positively impact knowledge, attitudes and behaviours with regard to climate change, biodiversity conservation and sustainable island management. <br/><br/>The educational messages promoted in the radio drama will generate new appreciation for the effects of climate change and will encourage constituents to embrace adaptive measures such as the rehabilitation and conservation of natural sea defences like mangroves and coral reefs, and projects designed to build resilience against hurricanes. A key message throughout the program is “community engagement” in protected areas, with the public awareness strategy targeting gaps in knowledge, attitudes and behaviours as they relate to priority protected areas of the OECS. As the “communications platform” for another LifeWeb submission (OECS/TNC) to fully fortify the protected areas of the OECS, this program will directly support public engagement in protected areas.",

		"participation": "My Island – My Community will build a sustainable coalition of local, regional and international organizations using public awareness and communications tools to respond to the challenges of climate change across the 9 islands of the Eastern Caribbean.<br/><br/>The goal of My Island – My Community is to confront the emerging consequences of climate change by expanding the capacity of regional partners to effectively and sustainably use contemporary communications, networking, public awareness and behaviour change methods, covering and strengthening management across the Eastern Caribbean’s network of protected areas.  The project will ensure long-term functionality of this network by integrating these efforts to engage the public in supporting an effective protected area network. Currently, community and political awareness regarding the values of and threats to protected areas is extremely low.  My Island – My Community will promote: ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change; multiple-use marine zoning; sustainable finance mechanisms; and community well-being and livelihood opportunities. <br/><br/>The overarching objectives for the three years of the program are:<br/>•\tDevelop the capacity of local organizations across the Eastern Caribbean to use communications to effectively enhance CBA activities and motivate long-term social change;<br/>•\tBuilding a community of coalitions and well-informed constituencies that understand and support PAs and CBA activities; and, <br/>•\tPositively change community knowledge, attitudes and behaviours related to climate change, protected areas, and CBA activities. <br/><br/>The program aims to: <br/>•\tIncrease appreciation of the region’s natural resources, including how resource conservation and species preservation can reduce poverty and ensure sustainable development; <br/>•\tIncrease awareness of links between climate change, environmental degradation, and activities of the public;<br/>•\tIncrease willingness of individuals to take action on matters related to biodiversity conservation, climate change adaption and sustainable land management; and,<br/>•\tIncrease community action and the number of organizations supporting mitigation and implementing projects for mitigation and adaption to climate change.<br/><br/>My Island – My Community will utilize Media Impact's My Community approach to communications that was developed during 25 years of working with local partners, as an effective, transformational, rigorous and community-driven Communications for Change methodology. The Eastern Caribbean initiative will focus on developing the capacity of local coalitions to produce public awareness and behaviour change campaigns using the My Community Entertainment Education and Community Action methodologies. The partnership program will create a comprehensive regional communications initiative, including:<br/><br/>1.\tRegional Radio Serial Drama (208 episodes); <br/>•\t9 National Radio Magazines (over 1000 hours of community discussion on the radio); <br/>•\t9 National Social Marketing Campaigns – one on each island; <br/>•\tPeer to Peer Exchange Program (journalists, protected area managers, government, NGOs, etc); <br/>•\tA sophisticated web presence, including an on-line forum, best practice site, etc; <br/>•\tIntegrated Music programme; <br/>•\tTV initiative, such as “Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader – Climate Change”; <br/>•\tCapacity Building Workshops for (journalists, protected area managers, government, NGOs, etc); and,<br/>•\t24/7 Mentoring and Support.<br/><br/>Together, these elements will create a “buzz” around the issue of climate change; stimulate discussion on issues pertaining to climate change, biodiversity and other social issues; and support engagement of the public in responding effectively to opportunities and threats. <br/><br/>Phase 1: Coalition Building and Formative Research (Jan-April 2010)<br/>The foundation of the My Community approach to communications is partnership and engagement with the community. The first phase, launched in January 2010, will identify and help build a coalition consisting of a lead NGO/CBO with local service providers, other NGO/CBOs, scientists and local radio broadcast teams in each of the 9 participating countries. A call for participation has been circulated widely in the region. A thoughtful selection and outreach process will identify the strong coalitions critical to the long-term success of the program.<br/><br/>Also during this phase, a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) has been established. The TAC, consisting of representatives of relevant government ministries, NGOs, partner organizations and informed community groups, will work to ensure the “best of science” is integrated into the communication campaigns. The TAC will help ensure that the content of the drama accurately represents the results of all scientific work being conducted in the field. <br/>Formative research commenced in 2009. Participatory investigative research from meetings and interviews with members of the target audience will help shape the content of the programs by identifying priority issues for the community, and prevailing attitudes and information gaps among the audience. The project teams will use this information to develop entertainment media and campaign materials.  <br/><br/>Phase 2: Training and Work planning: Capacity Building Workshop (April/May 2010)  <br/>My Island - My Community will hold a two-week regional capacity building workshop (April 26 – May 7, 2010) for national partners (two from each coalition), producers, directors, and writers on how to develop a communications strategy and serial drama for social change. Further, the workshop will provide core training in Communications for Change and background on climate change challenges confronting the Eastern Caribbean. The training workshop will include a presentation of the findings of preliminary formative research. Participants will use the formative research to design the characters, settings and story lines for the serial drama. Additionally, training will be provided in how to run complementary radio magazine shows and support community action campaigns. <br/><br/>Phase 3: Implementation and Mentoring (July 2010 – Dec 2011) <br/>My Island – My Community will produce 208 episodes of a two year regional radio serial drama. Each episode of the serial drama will last approximately 15-minutes and will be incorporated into a one-hour magazine show. The magazine show will be unique to each of the 9 OECS countries and include a call-in component specifically for local audiences to opine about local issues.  Other entertainment vehicles to engage and retain the audience will be incorporated as well, including interviews from the street, music and games. These broadcasts will support Peer-to-Peer Learning Exchanges and motivate Community Action Campaigns all as part of the greater awareness campaign.  <br/><br/>Radio Serial Dramas - The serial drama is central to the messaging of the program.  An entertaining storyline (approx. 70%) will be augmented with educational content (30%) to motivate attitude and behaviour change throughout the Eastern Caribbean with regard to biodiversity conservation and sustainable management. Once produced, each of the 208 episodes will be broadcast on local and national radio stations. Along with these broadcasts, the program will be uploaded each week on other social network sites, such as YouTube and Facebook. <br/><br/>Radio Magazines – National coalitions will be trained to design and produce “Radio Magazines”. This will provide a chance for the public to directly engage in the stories and messages of the radio drama. A “magazine” format could include call-in, radio quests, factual discussions, announcements, good practices recognition, awards, etc. Through this mechanism, each island-focused discussion will offer a critical opportunity for community members to react to the story and issues highlighted. <br/><br/>Community Action Campaigns - Each of the 9 National Coalitions (one per island) will develop a Community Action Campaign that will run in parallel to the Radio Drama series and will emphasize creating strategic partnerships to support actions in support of CBA. Activities might include events, written materials, speaker-series, school visits, etc. Community Action grants will be provided to support these activities. National Coalitions will be trained in mobilizing volunteers and will explore other strategic mechanisms to more deeply engage the public in CBA. <br/><br/>Phase 4: Learning, Monitoring, Evaluation and Strategic Planning - The program will incorporate participatory M/E as an element of program design and will evaluate for impacts on: (1) Capacity; (2) Community; and (3) Change in knowledge, attitudes and behaviours. A rigorous M/E and Learning Strategy will be developed and implemented with input from national coalitions and the TAC. An annual Learning Workshop will allow for the sharing of best practices, celebrating success, developing regional initiatives and engaging with the TAC. <br/><br/>Phase 5: Building an Enduring Network - The My Community approach to communications facilitates partnerships and networking by bringing together social actors to work towards achieving a unifying goal. Additionally, the coalition building, training and annual Learning Workshops will encourage the formation of regional alliances by not only bringing together the various local partners, but also through the creation of a My Island – My Community community that will:<br/><br/>•\tCelebrate regional successes and share best practices; <br/>•\tActively engage in peer-to-peer learning and other capacity development activities; <br/>•\tDevelop and implement regional activities;<br/>•\tUndertake regional program and policy initiatives; <br/>•\tEnsure access to timely and relevant information through its own knowledge-sharing website and programmatic communications (newsletter, monthly updates, etc.).",

The migration does not follow fixed routes, however, it can be disturbed by human activity such as domestic herding, mining and other industrial activity (more than half of the country is at least nominally designated for minerals exploitation).   Effective contiguity among the three protected areas that comprise the project area will be essential for future North-South migrations.  The grassland types effected in the project are underrepresented in protected areas both in Mongolia and worldwide.

		"description": "Mongolia has benefitted from extensive planning for biodiversity and protected areas, including through the generous support of multiple partners.  Key documents describing the country’s context and challenges include:<br/><br/>Assessment of Implementation of First Phase of Mongolia Protected Areas Program of Work, MNET with WWF, April 2009<br/><br/>Strengthening of the Protected Areas Network in Mongolia, UNDP<br/><br/>Briefly, Mongolia faces many challenges of the commons when addressing protected areas management.  Under the socialist era, there were approximately 25 million livestock.  Now, with the opportunities presented by the market economy, especially the demand for cashmere wool, there are over 40 million livestock being herded in Mongolia.  To date, neither the government nor others have been able to find a formula to address the reality of overgrazing while also properly addressing herder interest in enhanced economic returns. Climate change is another major factor.  Some estimates state that temperatures in Mongolia have risen three times faster than those in comparable geographies over the past ten years.  Many lakes and rivers essential to herds and to grasslands health have dried up.<br/><br/>This project will focus on such macro concerns as they are experienced by local communities and in specific protected areas.  The three areas collectively comprising the project site have different degrees of PA management along with varied community circumstances.  The Toson Khulstai Nature Preserve benefits from an anti-poaching strategy, the first protected area co-management committee in Mongolia, international NGO support, and a proportionally greater government funding commitment to PA administration which has followed the step by step progress at the preserve.  The resident herder community consists of 200 families with approximately 91,000 livestock.  Other traditional herders and commercial operations have brought additional livestock to the preserve in recent years in response to overgrazing and drought affecting their usual grazing areas.    Ugtam has an established herder community which is engaged with local NGOs concerned about preservation issues.  Khar Yamaat does not have a strong resident herder community.  There is grazing at both Khar Yamaat and Ugtam and PA management is rudimentary at best at both PA’s.<br/><br/>The projected project area covers three provinces and a half dozen soum, the next largest government jurisdiction below the province level.  One soum has much of its territory within Toson Khulstai, and the national government may soon establish a new PA in that same soum, bringing issues of income sourcing to the fore for local government operations.",

		"description": "The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) 1 is the largest and most diverse part of the greater Micronesian sub-region of the vast Pacific region. It is a federation of four semi-autonomous island States, in geographic sequence from east to west - Kosrae, Pohnpei, Chuuk and Yap - comprised of 607 islands with land elevation ranging from sea level to the highest elevation of about 2,500 feet (760 m). FSM’s total landmass is 438 square miles (702 km²), with a declared Exclusive Economic Zone covering over 1 million square miles (1.6 million km²). Traditional, social and cultural institutions are still very strong in Micronesia. Micronesian society is based on the extended family, which is responsible for the family welfare, especially in relation to customary family land. The indigenous population is Micronesian with most of the people residing on the main islands of the State capitals. Its marine and terrestrial biodiversity are the nation’s living wealth in which species endemism is high among the terrestrial biota. The high endemism within the nation is a direct result of the isolation of the islands to one another and to other landmasses in the greater Micronesian region. Land and aquatic tenure varies between States where the two most Eastern States – Kosrae and Pohnpei, land is both privately and State owned, while aquatic areas are managed by the State as public trusts. In Chuuk, most land and aquatic areas are privately owned and acquired through inheritance, gift or, recently, by purchase. In Yap, almost all land and aquatic areas are owned or managed by individual estates and usage is subject to traditional control. In all States, land cannot be sold to non-citizens of the FSM, thus these land and aquatic ownership patterns greatly influence the strategies and actions required to sustainably manage the biodiversity of the nation. Thus a necessity in engaging these local stakeholders to raise their awareness on and address certain threats which include explicit increasing pressures from climate change, resource over-harvest, non-application of efficientselective technology and land-based sources of pollution. <br/><br/>The responsibility for environmental issues is shared between the FSM National Government and the individual FSM State governments. The sharing of responsibility has at times resulted in legislation that appears duplicated at the State and National levels. It has also resulted in gaps in legislation and areas in which the location of responsibility between the State and National Governments has been less than clear. Each State has made efforts to control development and manage natural resources through the creation of land use plans, coastal zone plans, legislation and regulations. The National Government provides guidance and technical assistance to the States when needed and requested on matters related to planning, economic development, natural resources, fisheries, and the environment. The Federated States of Micronesia Protected Areas Network (FSM-PAN) Project <http://www.protectedareas.org/> has been developed to address the Convention on Biological Programme of Work on Protected Areas in which the project’s four outcomes set the foundation of establishing a protected areas network to address the above mentioned natural resource management issues in a systematic framework. Most of the FSM’s existing PAs use a combination of traditional and legislative controls. This dual authority approach has been quite successful, and it is locally perceived to 1 http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/islands_oceans_poles/statesmicronesia.jpg be an effective way of establishing protected areas. The development of a national protected areas network offers a major opportunity to provide a framework for the FSM’s national and state governments to collaborate on the dual objectives of protecting the country’s terrestrial and marine biodiversity and assisting with local management of natural resources through establishing an interconnected network of protected areas. <br/><br/>The decentralized political situation in the FSM and the prevalence of private and/or traditional control of lands and waters throughout the nation necessitates broad public consultations to build public understanding of and will toward the importance of conservation and the role of protected areas. In addition, many of the nation’s areas of biodiversity significance are remote and isolated, requiring a significant management role by local communities and land-owners. It is envisioned that most protected areas will be initiated at the community level, where they will be well-supported locally and address local resource over-exploitation concerns. Involving as many stakeholders as possible in the development of the national protected areas network will ensure eventual success.",

Maintaining the habitats and ecosystems that nurture this diversity is crucial to sustaining the country’s rich ethnobiological traditions while improving Micronesians’ quality of life since sixty percent (60%) of its population is dependent on subsistence livelihoods (ADB, 2004). Further inventory and monitoring of the FSM terrestrial and marine biodiversities are integral and priority to a thorough understanding and appreciation of the islands’ biodiversity. The spread of invasive species is a continual threat due to increased movement of people and machinery between the islands, and needs to be carefully monitored and controlled.

In addition, despite the enormous efforts made to date, Costa Rica’s protected area system still has conservation gaps that must be addressed if the desired ecological representation is to be achieved.   <br/><br/>The greatest ecological gap is in the coastal-marine environment.  Costa Rica is among the 20 most biologically diverse countries in the world. Its marine biodiversity is distributed over an area of 567,928 km2 in both the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. It is estimated that the country’s coastal areas and marine waters are home to approximately 6,700 marine species, or 3.5% of the world’s total marine species, among which 90 are endemic. Costa Rica’s jurisdictional marine environments serve as a permanent or temporary home to a large number of species of global importance, including the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus); five species of sea turtles, including the leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), the green turtle (Chelonia mydas), and the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta); whales and dolphins (i.e., the humpback whale - Megaptera novaeangliae, the false killer whale - Pseudorca crassidens, the pantropical spotted dolphin - Stenella attenuate, and the estuarine Tucuxi dolphin - Sotalia guianensis); a large number of widely distributed and endemic fish species, the latter of which are found mostly in the Cocos Island area; and a large number of marine invertebrates, including the queen conch (Strombus gigas), the spiny lobster (Panulirus argus), the spotted spiny lobster (P. guttatus), and the piagua clam (Anadara sp.). Additionally, high productivity levels in the Pacific Ocean that result from major upwellings also sustain a regionally significant marine fishery.<br/>Costa Rica faces resource overexploitation, habitat degradation, unregulated coastal development, pollution, invasive species and climate change as major threats to marine biodiversity. In addition, the MPAs’ managers do not possess a full range of tools needed for effective MPA management. Unlike their terrestrial counterparts, MPAs do not have a marine assessment and monitoring strategy with clearly defined indicators that would assist in the decision-making processes or help in assessing the progress towards achieving biodiversity conservation goals. Only 12 of the 21 present MPAs have a management plan and some of the existing plans may need to be updated to face new challenges for the MPAs, including climate change. <br/>The project will help to reduce threats to terrestrial and marine biodiversity by: (1) protecting key habitats to prevent their degradation; (2) identifying MPAs that are most affected by climate change, incorporating climate change mitigation and adaptation into their management plans, and the preliminary monitoring of affected key species and ecosystems and (3) promoting sustainable fisheries and tourism. Consequently, Costa Rica’s long-term solution to the ongoing loss of biodiversity depends on consolidating its MPAs through increased ecological representation, improved management effectiveness in both terrestrial and marine PAs, and ensured financial sustainability for the entire PA system.",

		"ecological_contribution": "Overall, the existing terrestrial protected area system conserves 1,339,860 hectares of Costa Rica’s lands. Approximately 26 percent of the terrestrial territory of the country is within some form of conservation designation, with about half of that being in what is referred to as the most “strict” protected areas (IUCN Categories I and II).  The freshwater protected area system conserves 47 of the country’s 64 stream systems. There are 50 lake systems protected of the 92 lakes that ideally should be conserved.  The ecological gaps in the terrestrial and freshwater realms are far more modest than in the marine realm. To reach its POWPA goals, the government proposes to acquire new lands and expand the boundaries of existing terrestrial protected areas by about 24,350 hectares. Of these, 4,455 hectares would be for IUCN categories <br/>I and II:<br/>•\texpanding the boundaries of the Alberto Manuel Brenes Biological Reserve, and<br/>•\tchanging the management category of the Pococí Watershed Protection Zone to that of national park while also expanding its area. <br/><br/>Costa Rican coastal and marine ecosystems are largely under-represented in the PAS, including sandy and rocky beaches, rocky and soft sea bottoms, coral communities and seagrasses of the Pacific Ocean, upwelling zones, and congregation areas for whales, whale sharks, lobsters, and fish. New MPAs are also needed to protect coastal areas and most of the oceanic areas of biological importance. Currently, only 21 of the total number of conservation areas (i.e. 169) are MPAs, and these cover only 5,140 km2, or 1% of the country’s jurisdictional waters. The recently concluded Coastal and Marine Conservation Gap Analysis (GRUAS II) identified 34 areas (20,985 km2) that are in need of conservation, among which 12 areas (16,300 km2) are considered to be of high priority. Their management remains weak; for example, only a fraction of the MPAs have completed and updated their management plans. In addition, management skills within the PAs are weak and the financial sustainability of Costa Rica’s MPAs is far from being achieved. <br/>Twelve MPAs will be created and/or expanded through the project to increase coverage of the MPAs and their improved ecological representation in the PAS. MPAs will be created and/or expanded in 12 prioritized sites in both the Pacific Ocean (Dominical-Sierpe, Bahía de Santa Elena, Golfo de Papagayo, Punta Gorda-Punta Pargos, Golfo Dulce, Isla del Caño, Corcovado, Chira-Tempisque  in Golfo de Nicoya, Isla del Coco and Montañas Submarinas Cocos, and Cabo Blanco) and the Caribbean Sea (Gandoca and Barra del Colorado). This action will result in an increase of MPA coverage up to 16,300 km2. By the end of the project, Costa Rica will have up to 3.8% (21,733 km2) of its jurisdictional marine waters under protection. In addition, through the project, marine ecosystem representation will be increased by up to 24% of the total area identified as marine conservation gaps. This will include an increase of 59.9% of terrestrial-coastal areas; 40.6% of marine areas 0 to 30 meters deep, 19.9 % of marine areas 30 to 200 meters deep, and 2.5% of oceanic areas >200 meters deep. Management plans will be developed for the newly created and/or expanded MPAs. Management plans will include biological monitoring mechanisms to assess conservation impacts and will incorporate a strategy to mitigate climate change. Biological indicators will be identified and developed following the guidelines set by PROMEC to guarantee that biological monitoring activities are integrated with the country’s wider monitoring efforts for PAs.<br/>The project will provide global environmental benefits by expanding existing and/or creating new MPAs that will increase the representativeness of marine ecosystems in Costa Rica’s PAS and through the protection of reproduction, nursery, and feeding habitat and migration routes for species of global importance. The protection of pelagic zones and deep-sea areas and bottoms (> 200-meter), coral reefs, seagrass beds, rocky and sandy beaches, mangroves, coastal lagoons, and estuaries will increase ecosystem representation. Additionally, the project will protect species of global importance, including the humpback whale, the whale shark, the leatherback turtle, the green sea turtle, the loggerhead sea turtle, and the West Indian manatee.",

In addition, despite the enormous efforts made to date, Costa Rica’s protected area system still has conservation gaps that must be addressed if the desired ecological representation is to be achieved.   <br/><br/>The greatest ecological gap is in the coastal-marine environment.  Costa Rica is among the 20 most biologically diverse countries in the world. Its marine biodiversity is distributed over an area of 567,928 km2 in both the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. It is estimated that the country’s coastal areas and marine waters are home to approximately 6,700 marine species, or 3.5% of the world’s total marine species, among which 90 are endemic. Costa Rica’s jurisdictional marine environments serve as a permanent or temporary home to a large number of species of global importance, including the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus); five species of sea turtles, including the leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), the green turtle (Chelonia mydas), and the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta); whales and dolphins (i.e., the humpback whale - Megaptera novaeangliae, the false killer whale - Pseudorca crassidens, the pantropical spotted dolphin - Stenella attenuate, and the estuarine Tucuxi dolphin - Sotalia guianensis); a large number of widely distributed and endemic fish species, the latter of which are found mostly in the Cocos Island area; and a large number of marine invertebrates, including the queen conch (Strombus gigas), the spiny lobster (Panulirus argus), the spotted spiny lobster (P. guttatus), and the piagua clam (Anadara sp.). Additionally, high productivity levels in the Pacific Ocean that result from major upwellings also sustain a regionally significant marine fishery.<br/>Costa Rica faces resource overexploitation, habitat degradation, unregulated coastal development, pollution, invasive species and climate change as major threats to marine biodiversity. In addition, the MPAs’ managers do not possess a full range of tools needed for effective MPA management. Unlike their terrestrial counterparts, MPAs do not have a marine assessment and monitoring strategy with clearly defined indicators that would assist in the decision-making processes or help in assessing the progress towards achieving biodiversity conservation goals. Only 12 of the 21 present MPAs have a management plan and some of the existing plans may need to be updated to face new challenges for the MPAs, including climate change. <br/>The project will help to reduce threats to terrestrial and marine biodiversity by: (1) protecting key habitats to prevent their degradation; (2) identifying MPAs that are most affected by climate change, incorporating climate change mitigation and adaptation into their management plans, and the preliminary monitoring of affected key species and ecosystems and (3) promoting sustainable fisheries and tourism. Consequently, Costa Rica’s long-term solution to the ongoing loss of biodiversity depends on consolidating its MPAs through increased ecological representation, improved management effectiveness in both terrestrial and marine PAs, and ensured financial sustainability for the entire PA system.",

		"description": "Yayu forest is one of the important forest priority areas in Ethiopia. It has a high number of plant and animal species. Over 450 higher plants, 50 mammal, 200 bird, and 20 amphibian species have been recorded in the area. The forest is also one of the few remnant habitats for wild coffee (Coffea arabica). Ethiopia is the only center of origin and diversity for C. arabica and hence is important for the in situ conservation of the genetic diversity of the natural coffee. Additionally, the forest area is vital for its ecological services such carbon sequestration and watershed protection for human health and hydropower generation. As part of the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity hot spot area, the forest is important for the conservation of biodiversity at both regional and global level.<br/><br/>The Yayu coffee forest is also important for the livelihoods of local households and stakeholders at different levels. It is a source of income for the locals and also a safe guard in difficult times such as during extreme weather events or poor harvest. the forest is a major source of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) and other products of local use such as construction material, fuel wood, and farm implements.  The most common NTFPs include coffee, honey, medicinal plants, spices and game. Forests and semi-forest coffee contributes to about 46% of households’ income in the area, while plantation coffee in transition areas contributes to about 21% of the households’ income. <br/><br/>Even though the forest is important for both conservation and the livelihoods of local people, it faces severe threats of deforestation. Major causes of deforestation are conversion to agricultural land and large scale monoculture plantation as well as over-grazing by livestock. Over the past 30 years alone, more than 60 % of the forest in the region has been converted to other land uses. Most of the remaining forest area is highly degraded due to intensive management for coffee production and selective logging. In spite of these facts, none of the forest area in the country is represented in the protected area system of the country. With the high rates of deforestation and forest degradation several species unique to this forest habitat are lost. Particularly, the loss of the genetically highly diverse wild populations of coffee might have far-reaching economic consequences. The wild coffee populations are an irrecoverable genetic resource for coffee production both nationally and internationally. <br/><br/>This project, therefore, aims at reducing deforestation and forest degradation while contributing to the improvement of local livelihoods through adaptive conservation-development integration activities. To achieve this, the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve approach is adapted.  The Yayu Coffee Forest Biosphere Reserve has been nominated by the government of Ethiopia in September 2009 and expected to be approved by UNESCO in mid-2010.",

		"ecological_contribution": "Yayu forest is an important area from an eco-regional perspective. The forest vegetation is predominantly of the Afromontane type. Studies by Gole (2003) and Senbeta (2006) have shown that there are several Afromontane endemic plant species in the Yayu forest like Allophylus abyssinicus, Brucea antidysenterica, Cassipourea malosana, Coffea arabica, Deinbollia kilimandscharica, Dracaena afromontana, Galiniera saxifraga, Ekebergia capensis, Dracaena steudneri, Ilex mitis, Maytenus arbutifolia, Myrsine Africana, Prunus africana, Olinia rochetiana and others.  It also has several species of the Guinueo-Congolian forest vegetation and many more species linking the Afromontane with other forest vegetations in Africa and Southeast Asia. The forest combines different types of conservation priorities being a biodiversity hot spot, a center for plant diversity and an origin for crop plants, an important bird breeding area and an important part of the Nile-Basin. Several major tributaries of the Nile originate from or drain from this area. These include rivers like Geba, Baro, Sor, Dabana and Dedesa. The forest cover within the catchment area plays an important role for watershed protection, flood prevention and sustainable water supply downstream to for example Sudan and Egypt.<br/><br/>A multi-disciplinary research on the Yayu forest and other similar coffee forests in Ethiopia since 2000 has revealed that Yayu forest is unique in terms of species composition and genetic diversity and genotypic composition of the wild coffee populations. It is also the largest remnant coffee forest fragment in Ethiopia. An assessment of a sampling of ca. 300 individuals from well documented wild coffee populations (Yayu, Berhane Kontir, Bale, Bonga, Boginda, Mankira, Bench Maji, Anfilo, Daphe) carried out by Tesfaye (2006) clearly confirmed the existence of a high molecular-genetic diversity in wild coffee populations with complex geographical patterns. The comparison with Ethiopian landraces (farmer’s varieties) and commercial cultivars shows that wild populations of Coffea arabica are genetically different and can be distinguished from semi-domesticated plants. The interregional patterns of genetic diversity in wild C. arabica indicate that a hierarchical-geographical structure is obscured by naturally occurring gene flow. Moreover, the interregional analysis with samples collected all over Ethiopia revealed the presence of unique genotypes in Yayu forest with above-average genetic diversity. The dense sampling of C. arabica with ISSRs (inter simple sequence repeats) in forests of Yayu (Geba Dogi) and Berhane Kontir shows a fine-scale spatial patterning of genotypes in wild populations. Molecular data generally support the existence of truly wild populations that differ from semi-domesticated and bred plants, and underscore the need of conserving the wild coffee. <br/><br/>The existing protected areas in Ethiopia were established to protect large mammals and are restricted to lowland grasslands and woodlands. Forest vegetations are mainly found at high altitudes and none of the country’s forests fall within the existing protected areas. Specifically there is no protected area in the south-western highlands of the country where over 60% of the country’s forest cover is located.  Based on the species, genetic, and ecosystem diversity as well as socio-economic data, the Yayu Coffee Forest has been identified as a top priority for conservation.",

As part of the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity hot spot area, the forest is important for the conservation of biodiversity at both regional and global level.<br/><br/>The Yayu coffee forest is also important for the livelihoods of local households and stakeholders at different levels. It is a source of income for the locals and also a safe guard in difficult times such as during extreme weather events or poor harvest. the forest is a major source of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) and other products of local use such as construction material, fuel wood, and farm implements.  The most common NTFPs include coffee, honey, medicinal plants, spices and game. Forests and semi-forest coffee contributes to about 46% of households’ income in the area, while plantation coffee in transition areas contributes to about 21% of the households’ income. <br/><br/>Even though the forest is important for both conservation and the livelihoods of local people, it faces severe threats of deforestation. Major causes of deforestation are conversion to agricultural land and large scale monoculture plantation as well as over-grazing by livestock. Over the past 30 years alone, more than 60 % of the forest in the region has been converted to other land uses. Most of the remaining forest area is highly degraded due to intensive management for coffee production and selective logging. In spite of these facts, none of the forest area in the country is represented in the protected area system of the country. With the high rates of deforestation and forest degradation several species unique to this forest habitat are lost. Particularly, the loss of the genetically highly diverse wild populations of coffee might have far-reaching economic consequences. The wild coffee populations are an irrecoverable genetic resource for coffee production both nationally and internationally. <br/><br/>This project, therefore, aims at reducing deforestation and forest degradation while contributing to the improvement of local livelihoods through adaptive conservation-development integration activities. To achieve this, the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve approach is adapted.  The Yayu Coffee Forest Biosphere Reserve has been nominated by the government of Ethiopia in September 2009 and expected to be approved by UNESCO in mid-2010.",

		"description": "The Sundarbans of Bangladesh are already experiencing the ecological effects of global climate change and declining freshwater supplies: seawater is encroaching farther into the mangrove forest and sedimentation is increasing in areas of key biological importance. Current understanding of the physical processes and details of ecological effects on this region and its wildlife are insufficient to develop the management strategies needed to protect this global “hotspot” of cetacean diversity and abundance. The sensitivity of dolphins in waterways of the Sundarbans in Bangladesh to physical and ecological changes related to freshwater inputs and sea-level rise led to a recommendation by the International Whaling Commission’ Scientific Committee that they be used as a case study for understanding the impacts of climate change on cetaceans (Smith et al. 2008). <br/><br/>At the same time, freshwater cetaceans in Bangladesh are threatened by increasing incidental kills, primarily from entanglement in gillnets but also from long lines and trawl fisheries. Bycatches occurring in these fisheries may also be undermining their sustainability. There is an urgent need to develop and promote less destructive fishing gear and practices and to establish time-area closures, both for protecting biodiversity and for ensuring the sustainability of fisheries vital to the economy and food security of local communities.<br/><br/>The Government of Bangladesh (GoB) and the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) seek to ensure the protection of freshwater cetaceans in Bangladesh now, while the population sizes of two species at risk are known to be sufficient for long-term persistence if threats can be reduced, while concurrently safeguarding the well-being of local fishermen who depend on the same aquatic resources. These aims have vital conservation and social-economic significance due to the sensitivity of the Sundarbans mangrove forest to the realized and projected impacts of climate change, and the role of its waterways in providing essential ecosystem services to local communities, including serving as a buffer to minimize the effects of extreme climate events. This project will fundamentally connect the welfare of fishermen and cetaceans, and engage local communities in the development of sustainable strategies for managing aquatic resources and adapting to climate related changes through the establishment of a protected area network that specifically addresses aquatic needs within the existing multiple-use Eastern Sundarbans Reserved Forest, and is focused on managing the mangrove forest and terrestrial wildlife.  The project addresses all four interlinked elements of the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) Program of Work on Protected Areas (PoWPA) in that it (1) strengthens an existing national system of protected areas as a contribution to globally recognized goals for species conservation, (2) promotes participation, equity and benefit sharing within the context of protecting threatened species and a vulnerable aquatic ecosystem, (3) establishes a sustainable program of enabling activities including capacity building, policy support, awareness raising, and targeted research, and (4) provides a rigorous mechanism for assessment and monitoring in support of management goals.  The project is also consistent with the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan, and National Adaptation Programme of Action (see attachments).<br/><br/>Based on conservation research and educational outreach conducted by WCS, on January 29, 2012 the Government of Bangladesh declared three new Wildlife Sanctuaries for the protection of freshwater dolphins in the Eastern Sundarbans Reserved Forest. These wildlife sanctuaries (Dhangmari, Chandpai, and Dudhmukhi) safeguard 19.4 mi (31.4 km) of channels. However, no management plan is in place and efforts to realize the new legislation into effective conservation tools are pending on financial support.",

		"ecological_contribution": "The Ganges River dolphin (Platanista gangetica), an obligate freshwater species, is in immediate danger of extinction. The diversity and scale of threats facing these animals indicate the need for more focused conservation attention. The Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) occupies both riverine and nearshore marine environments with freshwater input. Populations are low in every area where they have been studied, except in Bangladesh, and their range has significantly declined. Threats from bycatch and habitat degradation are severe and pervasive. Ganges River and Irrawaddy dolphins remain patchily distributed in the Sundarbans in sufficient numbers for early conservation interventions to be effective, and for the mangrove forest to serve as a global safety net for protecting both species.  Their populations in other areas are generally at higher risk due to low numbers and intensive human threats. The recent probable extinction of the Yangtze River dolphin (Lipotes vexillifer) has taught us that conservation efforts must begin early and focus on ecologically defined areas where human activities can be more effectively managed.  Freshwater dolphins depend on particular ecological features related to the geomorphic and hydraulic complexity of mangrove waterways. These features concentrate biological productivity, provide refuge from strong downstream and tidal currents and are generally the sites of maximum human activity. The protection of mangroves, especially in the fringe areas of the Sundarbans that are more heavily exploited by human communities compared to forests within the boundaries of the reserved forest, is intrinsically linked to preventing the loss of dolphin habitat and promoting sustainable fisheries. <br/><br/>This project aims to conserve Ganges River and Irrawaddy dolphins through the establishment of a protected area network in waterways of the Sundarbans mangrove forest that is based on sound science, benefits from positive local support, and is sustained by a well-trained, competent local team of government officials, community leaders, and volunteer university students.  Increasing recognition of the impacts of fisheries bycatch (Fahrni-Mansur et al. 2008; Smith et al. 2006), declining freshwater supplies, and sea-level rise (Smith et al. 2009) on freshwater cetaceans make this project a high priority for conserving these iconic species. Additionally, knowledge of the potential for these animals to serve as biological indicators of the ecosystem-level impacts of these threats and inform the development of adaptive human-wildlife management to cope with the impacts of climate change (Smith et al. 2008) suggests an even broader potential for conservation and development benefits. The project supports the goals of the CBD in facilitating conservation and sustainable use through protected areas and by improving their coverage, representativeness and management. The value of protected area networks for conserving freshwater cetaceans was highlighted at the First International Conference on Marine Mammal Protected Areas (http://www.icmmpa.org; Mansur et al. 2009).",

Without the preservation of this area, the impacts on the water supply to the south of this water scarce island as well as the birds that use the country as part of their migratory route, will be devastating.  Thirdly, there are efforts underway to help in the development of a biodiversity corridor within the interior of Antigua. One of the sites that will form a part of this project would seek to protect the last remaining naturally rich biodiversity area within the country’s interior and would therefore be a critical link in this corridor to be created.",

It is the intent of the project to protect the site and allow for the effective preservation of the history of the area. Additionally, the site has been found to have a significant amount of culturally important plant species traditionally used by the population. The preservation of these plants are paramount if their uses are to be effectively assessed and their integrity preserved.   "

The project will help to mitigate impacts of invasive alien species on the agricultural sector.   One of the targeted sites contains extensive areas of fringing mangroves and seagrass beds considered of vital importance to commercial fisheries.  Mangroves of this site serve other key functions, such as habitat for one of the largest populations of the Magnificent Frigate bird and protection of coastal areas from storm surge associated with severe weather events; thus providing additional justification for its protected area status and need for effective management.  The other site contains an area zoned for agricultural research and an invasive species, the African Snail, poses a threat to plant material being produced for farmers.     "

The project is designed to assist in reducing the incidences of indiscriminate land clearing in the watershed that supports and recharges the aquifer.  By so doing it will address the critical issue of fresh water security in the protecting of one of the largest watersheds in Antigua.   Currently, there are situations where areas at the demonstration sites are cleared without any consideration for the impact this has on the rate of surface water runoff and reduced water infiltration into soils containing sources of ground water.   Protection of upland forests, particularly in one of the targeted sites, will lead also to the conservation of native plants, birds and a number of other species of fauna.     "

Birds tagged from this colony have been spotted as far as South America.<br/><br/> Additionally, the national park hosts a number of West Indian Whistling Ducks, a species that is endangered in the Caribbean. A number of other species of flora and fauna are hosted within the boundaries of the national park, which covers approximately 18km2. Some of these have important economic value for the country. For example, the island of Barbuda has a large fishing industry that depends heavily on the sale of lobster and fish to neighbouring islands. The Lagoon is a nursery for the development of these species. Without effective management of the national park, the sustainability of this industry and the livelihood of local communities of Barbuda will be seriously threatened.",

		"summary": "Though relatively intact, the Sapo National Park, Grebo National Forest, Grand Kru-River Gee National Forest, East Nimba Nature Reserve and the Lake Piso Sustainable Multiple Use Reserve face serious threats from illegal and unsustainable logging, unsustainable farming and illegal extraction of natural resources. The aim of this project is to strengthen the management of the existing protected areas and support the establishment of proposed protected areas and national parks in Liberia.",
		"description": "There are several threats to the conservation of biodiversity in protected areas of Liberia. The long civil war endured by Liberia in the past has meant that conservation actions have been given a low priority in recent years. Nonetheless, it is well documented that forested areas and local wildlife suffer from anthropogenic activities, such as the illegal and unsustainable logging, unsustainable farming, illegal extractive resource use such as mining and the bushmeat trade. Though relatively intact, Sapo National Park and Grebo National Forest as well as East Nimba Reserve and Lake Piso Sustainable Multiple Use Reserve face imminent threats from the increasing influx of human population in the respective regions and the aforementioned anthropogenic activities that come along with this. Recent surveys carried out by the Forestry Development Authority and the WCF around e.g. Sapo NP highlight the range of these threats in the region.<br/><br/>Spread across the Liberian-Ivorian border, lies the Taï-Sapo Forest Complex, a region of very high levels of biodiversity and endemism. In October 2009, the Wild Chimpanzee Foundation (WCF) and the Great Ape Survival Partnership (GRASP/UNEP) in collaboration with the protected area managers of Liberia (Forestry Development Authority, FDA) and Côte d’Ivoire (Office Ivoirien des Parcs et Reserves, OIPR and Société de Développement des Forêts, SODEFOR), organized a workshop to initiate transboundary collaboration between Liberia and Côte d’Ivoire for the conservation of this Forest Complex and the implementation of landscape corridors to keep this important ecosystem intact (http://www.tai-sapo.org). Outcomes from the workshop highlighted the importance of imminent action needed in the region to effectively implement landscape corridors, both transboundary and national. Priority corridors were identified, of which one was the connection between the Sapo National Park (1550 km²) and the Grebo National Forest (2581 km²) and the existing natural corridors that join the Grebo National Forest to its counterparts in Côte d’Ivoire. Moreover, under the protected area (PA) network strategic plan of Liberia, Grebo National Forest and Grand Kru-River Gee National Forest are proposed to become national park, but the implementation of this process needs financial and technical support. East Nimba Reserve and Lake Piso Sustainable Multiple Use Reserve that are threatened by unsustainable land use practices, uncontrolled bushfires, extractive resource use such as overfishing and sand-mining, are two other areas within the Liberian PA network that need reinforced protection and management support.<br/><br/>Therefore, imminent studies and strengthened management strategies for the existing and proposed protected areas are crucial to ensure the survival of the largest remaining forest bloc in West Africa (Sapo-Grebo-Tai complex), unique ecosystems (East Nimba and Lake Piso Reserves) and the endangered and/or endemic species found therein. Livelihood support of the local communities surrounding the protected areas also has to be considered as it is a major problem confronting the protected areas. Most people living in communities around these PAs are unemployed; hence they derive their livelihood through farming, fishing, hunting and mining within the protected areas. Most of the people living in these communities live in abject poverty and face severe food insecurity. These problems also make the situation very volatile for the proper management of the protected areas. <br/><br/>For these issues to be properly addressed, alternative forms of livelihood must be introduced to the communities around the protected areas. In doing so, this will help enhance the management of the protected areas. It will also increase awareness of biodiversity conservation issues and its significance in livelihood and income generation. It will enhance and enforce the ability of local communities to engender interest in integrating sustainable farming and agro-forestry systems, reduce the dependency of communities on resources of protected areas and reduce poverty for people living adjacent to the protected areas.",

		"ecological_contribution": "In 1999, the West African Conservation Priority Setting Exercise brought together 150 experts in forestry, ecology, economics, politics and sociology of West Africa. This group identified Liberia as the top priority country for biodiversity conservation in the Upper Guinean Forest eco-region, a humid coastal rainforest belt stretching across six West African countries, including Liberia. The nation’s forests are among the world’s most exceptionally diverse forest ecosystems. They have high rates of endemism and are home to most of the wildlife species that are fleeing the scourge of deforestation and related activities and are at the verge of extinction in the other countries of the Upper Guinean Forest eco-region (UGF). The threatened and endemic faunal species include Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus), Red colobus monkey (Piliocolobus badius), Diana monkey (Ceropithecus diana diana), Pygmy hippopotamus (Hexaprotodron liberienses) and forest elephant (Loxodonta africana cyclotis), Jentink’s Duiker (Cephlophus jentinki), zebra duiker (C. zebra), Liberian Mongoose (Liberiitis kuhni) and the white-breasted Guinea fowl (Agelastes meleagrides). At the close of the millennium, Liberia harboured the largest remaining proportion of the UGF (43%), followed by Cote d’Ivoire (28%), Ghana (16%), Sierra Leone (5%) and Togo (1%)(24). Liberia’s forests now have the highest populations of elephants in West Africa, over 2900 flowering plants, including about 240 timber species and about 125 mammal species, 590 bird species, 74 known reptiles and amphibians and over 1000 described insect species. <br/><br/>Sapo National Park and Grebo National Forest represent 2 out of the 6 protected areas that currently make up the Taï-Sapo complex; 13.500 km2 of the largest, partly contiguous and remaining intact forest block of the Upper Guinean Forest Ecosystem. The Taï-Sapo complex also figures among the world’s 25 biodiversity hotspots and was categorized as exceptionally important (the highest rank possible) in relation to its ecosystem, forest cover, biodiversity and abundance of plants, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds and invertebrates during the priority setting exercise in 1999. Moreover, recent surveys carried out by the FDA, the WCF and MIKE (Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants) in the Sapo National Park in 2009 already suggest that more than 1,000 chimpanzees and an important elephant population find refuge there. Similar information for the Grebo National Forest and the Grand Kru-River Gee proposed protected areas are as of yet unknown, but crucial for effectively conserving this area. In-depth ecological gap analysis for these latter forests are of the utmost importance for the Taï-Sapo Forest Complex, to be able to efficiently manage the whole protected area network and sustain the long-term survival of the threatened species and other biodiversity.<br/><br/>The East Nimba Nature Reserve (ENNR) (13,500 hectares) was proposed to serve as a reserve in 1983 and was gazetted as a protected area in Liberia by an Act of the National Legislature in October 2003.The site is a unique mountainous ecosystem and is covered with mixed forest at its lower slope. On the peak and ridges of the mountain, the structure and composition change to a mountain forest, dominated by particular types of tree species such as Parinari excelsa and Garcina polyantha. No other protected area matches Lake Piso Multiple Use Reserve (97,159 hectares) with its rich endowment of a mosaic of habitats and landscapes such as coastal, marine, rainforest, mangrove, brackish water, island, and freshwater ecosystems. Biodiversity richness includes migratory bird species, sea turtles, hippos, manatees, primates, fish species and medicinal plants. Lake Piso Multiple Reserve consists of three main types of ecosystems that include humid forest, wetlands and coastal brackish lake and mangrove forests and dry land. Owing to their ecological significance and their contribution to safeguard vanishing and unique ecosystems, it is very important to put in place proper management of these PAs that will engender to address livelihood concerns.",

		"financial_sustainability": "In Liberia as well as in Côte d’Ivoire, the protected area network and its management is supported by the national governments as well as international donors. For Sapo National Park, the NGOs Fauna Flora International and Conservation International assist the FDA technically and financially as long-term partner organisations within Liberia. Besides state funds, Sapo NP receives additional funding through the FFEM (Fonds Français pour l’Environnement Mondiale), USAID, the Darwin Initiative and the European Union.<br/>In Côte d’Ivoire, besides state funds, the Taï National Park receives and has received for the past 20 years significant funding from the German Cooperation (KfW, GTZ), and additional funding through the World Wildlife Fund for Nature and the WCF. The Ivorian classified forests neighbouring Grebo National Forest are supported through a project from the FFEM and the WCF with prospect of continued funding for the coming 4 years. In Côte d’Ivoire, a Trust Fund has been set up for the sustainable funding of the Protected Areas and has received its first donation specific for the Taï National Park in 2009. Under the debt for nature swap scheme it is very likely that the German and the French governments will contribute to further funding of the Ivorian protected areas trust fund (FPRCI), focusing on sustainable financing of the protected areas within the Tai-Sapo complex on the Ivorian side. The possibility whether and how this Trust Fund could also support transboundary initiatives needs to be evaluated. The creation of a sustainable financing mechanism for the Liberian part of the transboundary protected area complex including Private Public Partnership agreements (likely with the cocoa sector under certification schemes) would be other ways that need to be explored for sustainable funding throughout the project. One expected long-term contribution to conservation activities in Liberia will be a 10% profit from logging operations in the country and plans to also establish a Trust Fund for the PA network.<br/>Some smaller scale funding has already been raised for various activities across the Taï-Sapo Complex, for example for sensitization activities (Arcus Foundation, Great Ape Conservation Fund), biomonitoring (Great Ape Conservation Fund, FFEM, STEWARD) and microprojects (FFEM), including Liberian protected areas (Sapo and Grebo). The Wild Chimpanzee Foundation and GRASP/UNEP as active supporters of the initiative have also developed further grant proposals to other potential donors for the conservation of the Taï-Sapo Corridor (e.g. Green IT project under the Korean government). The outcomes of the transboundary workshop carried out in October 2009 demonstrated the commitment of all stakeholders, notably the Forestry Development Authority and the government of Liberia who is a key actor in this project as well as the Ivorian government, NGOs as well as national and international research, development and conservation institutions of both countries. <br/><br/>Grand Kru-River Gee and Grebo National Forests are likely to receive funding in 2010 from GEF through the Worldbank to initiate the process of establishing the proposed protected areas and National Parks.<br/>The East Nimba Reserve is currently mainly depending on government support, with ARD/USAID support for rural development aspects. The Lake Piso Sustainbale Multiple Use Reserve establishment is currently supported by the Worldbank and FAO is working on market analysis and development aspects.",

		"alignment": "The Government of Liberia launched in February 2006 the development of an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy (IPRS), while formulating a 150-day plan of short-term reforms and deliverables in the four priority areas of Security, Economic Revitalization, Basic Services and Infrastructure, and Governance and Rule of Law. The IPRS focused on maintaining security and building peace; improving governance and the rule of law; revitalizing the economy; and rebuilding infrastructure and beginning to get basic services up and running. The sectoral priorities set by the Government under the four pillars of intervention adequately reflect Liberia’s development challenges in order to initiate a longer-term process of improving the livelihoods of Liberians and to reduce poverty on a country-wide basis.<br/><br/>Each pillar of the IPRS contains a matrix of time-bound policy objectives, operational programs, results/indicators and deliverables. Capacity building as well as job creation and service delivery measures have been mainstreamed into each pillar. The Government prepared a full poverty reduction strategy program (PRSP) in 2008 that successfully supported the four priority areas mentioned above. This project is tailored to fit within these PRSP priorities mainly through the provision of sustainable livelihood and income generation of communities around the protected areas and the strengthening of the management teams capacity to adequately manage these PAs. The Poverty reduction strategy (PRS) can be downloaded at: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2008/cr08219<br/><br/>This project is also intended to generate sustained improvements in human well-being, which lies at the heart of the MDGs, and relies fundamentally on the achievement of environmental sustainability (MGD – 7).<br/><br/>The proposition to reinforce existing protected areas and to establish new national parks such as the Grebo National Park or Grand Kru-River Gee, derive directly from the Protected Forest Area Network Strategic Plan of Liberia and fit well with the countries priorities.",

		"description": "La péninsule du Cap Blanc abrite quelques valeurs naturelles d’une grande importance et richesse à l’échelle régionale et planétaire. Il s’agit entre autres de la présence de la dernière colonie au monde de phoque moine de la Méditerranée, une des espèces les plus menacées d’extinction. La moitié de la population mondiale y est concentrée. La péninsule est également, de par sa situation géographique, un lieu important de passage pour les oiseaux migrateurs provenant d’Europe. Sa position au sein de l’affleurement permanent du Sahara « upwelling » lui permet de bénéficier d’une résurgence d’eaux marines profondes riches en nutriments qui favorisent l’existence d’un des bancs de pêche les plus riches du monde, soumis à l’exploitation intense de flottilles artisanales locales et industrielles de pays tiers. La péninsule du Cap Blanc compte plusieurs aires protégées parmi lesquelles ressort la Réserve Satellite du Cap Blanc - RSCB (qui dépend du Parc National du Banc d’Arguin – PNBA situé à proximité). Ses eaux et les plages qui l’entourent accueillent des membres de la dite colonie de phoque moine qui se trouve aujourd’hui en voie de récupération et d’expansion géographique. Elle reçoit également d’importantes populations d’oiseaux lors de leur migration annuelle.<br/><br/>Malgré l’énorme importance de cet environnement riche et diversifié dans la zone Nord de la Mauritanie, la plupart des habitants locaux sont mal informés de sa valeur, étrangers à cette richesse et leurs connaissances environnementales et leur implication envers la gestion durable des écosystèmes, aussi bien terrestres que marins, est très limitée. Les systèmes de surveillance de la réserve du Cap Blanc doivent aussi être améliorés pour contenir les activités illégales de pêche et les dérangements provoqués sur les phoques par la présence régulière d’embarcations et d’engins de pêche. L’éradication de la présence de pêcheurs à la ligne sur les falaises et au long du cordon littoral de la réserve est indispensable ainsi que le contrôle efficace de l’accès de visiteurs à des zones sensibles et de grande valeur écologique.<br/><br/>L’élimination de ces infractions est fondamentale pour permettre la recolonisation de cet espace par un plus grand nombre d’exemplaires de la colonie établie à proximité ainsi que pour favoriser son expansion géographique ici et à d’autres endroits comme le propre Parc National du Banc d’Arguin, un des points prioritaires du Plan d’action pour cette espèce dans l’Atlantique oriental (CMS/UNEP) qui a été souscrit par la Mauritanie, l’Espagne, le Portugal et le Maroc. La réserve est identifiée comme une Zone de conservation spéciale pour le phoque moine, est par conséquent un élément décisif dans la récupération de cette population qui se trouve en danger critique. Par ailleurs, l’élimination du mouillage illégal d’engins de pêche permettra d’accroître la régénération des ressources halieutiques dans la région.<br/><br/>L’importance de la réserve, les faibles moyens dont elle dispose actuellement et les fortes pressions qu’elle souffre dues à la proximité de la ville de Nouadhibou (120 000 habitants) justifient une intervention urgente pour améliorer la surveillance et l’information du publique. Par ailleurs, la récupération et l’expansion que connaît actuellement la colonie de phoque moine de la péninsule du Cap Blanc exigent que cette dernière fasse l’objet d’un suivi afin de pouvoir déterminer sa vitesse de croissance, la tendance, les menaces et les zones géographiques recolonisées.<br/><br/>L’importance du Parc National du Banc d’Arguin est assez connue particulièrement en ce qui concerne la biodiversité marine et les populations d’oiseaux migrateurs dont la réserve protégée abrite les plus importantes concentrations au monde en marée basse pendant l’hiver. Le PNBA est aussi le dernier refuge pour une population de gazelles dorcas résidente sur une des îles de cet espace protégé. L’espèce était auparavant abondante en Mauritanie et s’est raréfié progressivement en résultat de la sécheresse et surtout du braconnage intensifié à partir des années 60. La réintroduction de l’espèce dans la partie continentale du PNBA est un sujet d’actualité et une priorité clairement identifiée par l’ensemble des partenaires dans le plan de gestion du parc approuvé pour la période 2010 – 2014. L’actuelle capacité d’organisation et la structure de surveillance et contrôle en place au PNBA alliées à l’expérience de CBD Habitat dans ce domaine sont des atouts majeurs permettant d’envisager des actions préliminaires à l’établissement dans l’avenir d’une population continentale sauvage dans le PNBA.<br/><br/>La récente construction dans la Réserve du Cap Blanc du premier Centre de visiteurs dans une aire protégée d’Afrique occidentale et la proximité de la deuxième ville la plus importante de Mauritanie, et principal port du pays, font de cette aire protégée le site idéal pour organiser des activités d’éducation et d’information environnementale destinées à tous les secteurs de la population (élèves, pêcheurs, autorités, etc.) et surtout aux jeunes scolarisés et non-scolarisés pour renforcer leur implication envers la conservation des aires protégées et la gestion durable de l’environnement en général. La mise en place d’activités d’information et d’éducation à l’environnement est une des priorités du Plan d’Aménagement et Gestion du parc récemment approuvé pour la période 2010 – 2014.",

En fait ces deux aires marines protégées sont aussi des outils incontournables de gestion de la pêche en Mauritanie et qui contribuent à la régénération des ressources halieutiques et constituent ainsi un des principaux piliers de l’économie du pays.<br/><br/>Le maintien de la RSCB et du PNBA dans un bon état de conservation, grâce à une surveillance et à une gestion adéquates, facilitera leur recolonisation par les  phoques moines issus de la colonie du Cap Blanc, favorisant ainsi son expansion géographique et la réduction des risques inhérents à l’existence de populations concentrées dans des enclaves de petites dimensions. Ceci favorisera également la régénération des ressources halieutiques dont profiteront aussi surtout les pêcheurs artisans côtiers.<br/><br/>- L’application de mesures efficaces de surveillance, à travers l’amélioration d’infrastructures d’appui et la mise à dispositions des moyens nécessaires, favorisera la recolonisation progressive de la zone  par le phoque moine. Elle garantira également les conditions de tranquillité indispensables aux populations d’oiseaux marins nicheurs et le respect des textes légaux qui réglementent l’accés aux ressources marines dans le PNBA et la RSCB. <br/><br/>- La protection de cette importante surface côtière et marine améliorera l'état de conservation des ressources halieutiques en générale et du phoque moine en particulier à travers la diminution des risques de captures accidentelles par des engins de pêche et l’augmentation de la disponibilité en ressources alimentaires. Cette action aura un effet semblable pour les oiseaux piscivores. En outre, cette augmentation des ressources marines bénéficiera aux pêcheurs  en résultat de l’effet réserve et de la colonisation de zones de pêche à l’extérieur par les poissons issus de ces deux aires marines protégées. <br/>  <br/>- L’information de la population locale, principalement des pêcheurs qui partagent l’espace avec les espèces cible de conservation, au sujet des valeurs écologiques de la région et des avantages de réaliser une exploitation durable des ressources marines.<br/><br/>Le Banc d’Arguin est une formation sédimentaire naturelle, un banc de sable actuellement submergé, située au sud du Cap Blanc, à quelques 30 miles nautiques au large des côtes mauritaniennes. À son intérieur, protégée de la houle Atlantique, une zone semée d’iles côtières, de vasières et herbiers, absolument unique, héritage d’un Sahara humide devenu désert au long de quelques milliers d’années en résultat d’un phénomène naturel de changement climatique. Le Banc ne laisse pénétrer dans le Golfe d’Arguin que des eaux calmes et enrichies par un puissant upwelling quasi permanent dans le Golfe d’Arguin. Six mille kilomètres carrés d’hauts fonds d’une productivité spectaculaire abritent une biodiversité marine remarquable. Le littoral et les estrans du banc d’Arguin accueillent en hiver les plus grandes concentrations d’oiseaux d’eau de toute l’Afrique de l’Ouest. <br/><br/>La partie continentale abritait jusqu’aux années 70 une faune sahélo-sahélienne remarquable. Les populations d’antilopes tels que les Gazelles dorcas et dama, les Oryx et même peut-être les Addax, fréquentaient à l’époque l’actuelle enceinte continentale du Parc. Victimes de la combinaison d’une chasse non contrôlée de plus en plus efficace (véhicules 4X4, fusils de précision) et de la sécheresse intense des années soixante-dix, ces espèces continentales sont pratiquement toute disparues du Parc.<br/><br/>Convaincue de l’importance cruciale de maintenir l’intégrité de cette zone d’importance planétaire, la Mauritanie a décidé en 1976 de créer le Parc National du Banc d’Arguin. 12.000 km2 mis en réserve dont la moitié dans l’espace maritime. Un tiers de son littoral voué à la conservation de la biodiversité et au développement durable.  Pour accompagner la croissance des activités économiques sur le littoral, le PNBA a renforcé ses capacités d’intervention pour garantir la sauvegarde du territoire sous gestion et le développement durable des populations résidentes, seules bénéficiaires directes de l’exploitation des ressources naturelles.<br/><br/>La régression des populations de gazelles dorcas (Gazella dorcas) dans toute leur zone de distribution est un fait constaté aujourd’hui. La Mauritanie n’a pas échappé à cette tendance et la situation des gazelles dorcas sur le territoire mauritanien est préoccupante (Smith, T., 1998 ; Jebali, A. 2002 et 2008), même s’il reste de petites populations éparses. Le PNBA a autrefois abrité une population de 200 individus (Anonyme, 1987, in Smith, T. 1988), population qui s’est ensuite réduite à environ 100 individus en 1970 et à moins de 10 en 1983 (Verschuren, 1985 in Smith, T. 1998).",

The project aims to strengthen protected areas that are key for conservation of the Mediterranean Monk Seal and other emblematic species of Mauritania, through environmental education and increased support for management and monitoring.",
					"description": "La péninsule du Cap Blanc abrite quelques valeurs naturelles d’une grande importance et richesse à l’échelle régionale et planétaire. Il s’agit entre autres de la présence de la dernière colonie au monde de phoque moine de la Méditerranée, une des espèces les plus menacées d’extinction. La moitié de la population mondiale y est concentrée. La péninsule est également, de par sa situation géographique, un lieu important de passage pour les oiseaux migrateurs provenant d’Europe. Sa position au sein de l’affleurement permanent du Sahara « upwelling » lui permet de bénéficier d’une résurgence d’eaux marines profondes riches en nutriments qui favorisent l’existence d’un des bancs de pêche les plus riches du monde, soumis à l’exploitation intense de flottilles artisanales locales et industrielles de pays tiers. La péninsule du Cap Blanc compte plusieurs aires protégées parmi lesquelles ressort la Réserve Satellite du Cap Blanc - RSCB (qui dépend du Parc National du Banc d’Arguin – PNBA situé à proximité). Ses eaux et les plages qui l’entourent accueillent des membres de la dite colonie de phoque moine qui se trouve aujourd’hui en voie de récupération et d’expansion géographique. Elle reçoit également d’importantes populations d’oiseaux lors de leur migration annuelle.<br/><br/>Malgré l’énorme importance de cet environnement riche et diversifié dans la zone Nord de la Mauritanie, la plupart des habitants locaux sont mal informés de sa valeur, étrangers à cette richesse et leurs connaissances environnementales et leur implication envers la gestion durable des écosystèmes, aussi bien terrestres que marins, est très limitée. Les systèmes de surveillance de la réserve du Cap Blanc doivent aussi être améliorés pour contenir les activités illégales de pêche et les dérangements provoqués sur les phoques par la présence régulière d’embarcations et d’engins de pêche. L’éradication de la présence de pêcheurs à la ligne sur les falaises et au long du cordon littoral de la réserve est indispensable ainsi que le contrôle efficace de l’accès de visiteurs à des zones sensibles et de grande valeur écologique.<br/><br/>L’élimination de ces infractions est fondamentale pour permettre la recolonisation de cet espace par un plus grand nombre d’exemplaires de la colonie établie à proximité ainsi que pour favoriser son expansion géographique ici et à d’autres endroits comme le propre Parc National du Banc d’Arguin, un des points prioritaires du Plan d’action pour cette espèce dans l’Atlantique oriental (CMS/UNEP) qui a été souscrit par la Mauritanie, l’Espagne, le Portugal et le Maroc. La réserve est identifiée comme une Zone de conservation spéciale pour le phoque moine, est par conséquent un élément décisif dans la récupération de cette population qui se trouve en danger critique. Par ailleurs, l’élimination du mouillage illégal d’engins de pêche permettra d’accroître la régénération des ressources halieutiques dans la région.<br/><br/>L’importance de la réserve, les faibles moyens dont elle dispose actuellement et les fortes pressions qu’elle souffre dues à la proximité de la ville de Nouadhibou (120 000 habitants) justifient une intervention urgente pour améliorer la surveillance et l’information du publique. Par ailleurs, la récupération et l’expansion que connaît actuellement la colonie de phoque moine de la péninsule du Cap Blanc exigent que cette dernière fasse l’objet d’un suivi afin de pouvoir déterminer sa vitesse de croissance, la tendance, les menaces et les zones géographiques recolonisées.<br/><br/>L’importance du Parc National du Banc d’Arguin est assez connue particulièrement en ce qui concerne la biodiversité marine et les populations d’oiseaux migrateurs dont la réserve protégée abrite les plus importantes concentrations au monde en marée basse pendant l’hiver. Le PNBA est aussi le dernier refuge pour une population de gazelles dorcas résidente sur une des îles de cet espace protégé. L’espèce était auparavant abondante en Mauritanie et s’est raréfié progressivement en résultat de la sécheresse et surtout du braconnage intensifié à partir des années 60. La réintroduction de l’espèce dans la partie continentale du PNBA est un sujet d’actualité et une priorité clairement identifiée par l’ensemble des partenaires dans le plan de gestion du parc approuvé pour la période 2010 – 2014. L’actuelle capacité d’organisation et la structure de surveillance et contrôle en place au PNBA alliées à l’expérience de CBD Habitat dans ce domaine sont des atouts majeurs permettant d’envisager des actions préliminaires à l’établissement dans l’avenir d’une population continentale sauvage dans le PNBA.<br/><br/>La récente construction dans la Réserve du Cap Blanc du premier Centre de visiteurs dans une aire protégée d’Afrique occidentale et la proximité de la deuxième ville la plus importante de Mauritanie, et principal port du pays, font de cette aire protégée le site idéal pour organiser des activités d’éducation et d’information environnementale destinées à tous les secteurs de la population (élèves, pêcheurs, autorités, etc.) et surtout aux jeunes scolarisés et non-scolarisés pour renforcer leur implication envers la conservation des aires protégées et la gestion durable de l’environnement en général. La mise en place d’activités d’information et d’éducation à l’environnement est une des priorités du Plan d’Aménagement et Gestion du parc récemment approuvé pour la période 2010 – 2014.",

		"description": "Vietnam is one of the less forested countries that is currently witnessing advances in reforestation and regrowth. However, unnatural forests, deforestation and degradation of forests continues to be poorly controlled, mainly driven by illegal logging for the local market and often by the impoverished local communities. As a result of the growing timber needs of the booming timber industry and Vietnam’s forest protection measures, deforestation is shifting to neighbouring forest‐rich countries, particularly Laos. A report from the Environmental Investigation Agency from 2008 showed that in Protected Areas of Laos, timber is taken for illegal export. For 2006, it is estimated that 600,000 cubic meters of illegally cut wood stems from Laos alone. This cross‐border leakage is a challenge for REDD‐Readiness in Vietnam. Laos is still considered one of the richest southeastern Asian forested countries and at the same time has one of the highest deforestation rates (134,000 ha p.a.) that is responsible for approximately 70% of the national GHG emissions. The Annamites mountain chain in central Vietnam and southern Laos is recognized as a carbon sink and has globally one of the highest rates of endemism in a continental setting. It is here that five large mammals new to science have been discovered since 1992. The area is one of WWF’s global<br/>biodiversity eco‐regions.<br/><br/>Southern Laos harbors one of the largest connected natural forest areas in continental Asia and at the same time is a core area of deforestation and illegal logging.<br/><br/>Both countries are engaged in national and international REDD processes to protect the natural forests and forest biodiversity, while also limiting the release of GHG emissions.",

In Vietnam WWF is responsible within the national REDD network for the thematic focus \"International Leakage\". Hence the project provides a substantial contribution to the implementation of the new Lao‐Vietnamese agreement on crossborder illegal timber and wildlife trade control (signed in May 2009). Furthermore the project supports the Vietnamese forest development strategy (2006 – 2020), which aims at strengthening “the position of national parks such as Bach Ma and other protected areas\" in the project's target region. MARD as well as the forest protection departments of Thua Thien Hue and Quang Nam provinces have officially expressed their support for the project (see letters of support attached).<br/>The project contributes to the implementation of the Lao forest strategy 2020. The Lao forest administration and the team in charge of the implementation of the forest strategy 2020 have also expressed their support in writing. The national Vietnamese programme for adaptation to climate change (National Target Programme ‐ NTP) envisions especially the conservation and extension of the cover of watershed areas of regional forests in Central Vietnam.

		"description": "Cambodia's biodiversity and natural resources are in crisis. Despite some positive interventions over the last ten years, for example the delineation of several new (forest) areas under protection status, a moratorium on industrial logging and capacity-building efforts by international organisations, recent developments in Cambodia are increasingly threatening the integrity of the protected area system in the country. Cambodia still harbours forest and inland water ecosystems on a landscape level, mainly where there is a relatively low population density and where the civil war prevented large-scale transformation and conversion. During the nineties Cambodia was the target of excessive logging which resulted in degradation of ecosystem services as the country opened up its resources to the international market. Particularly, a forestry reform process, starting in 1999, has addressed some of the ineffective management in the sector and had some positive results. However, increasing foreign investment, systemic bureaucratic process and the lack of coherent policy over the last six years has led yet again to a semi-anarchic situation over the use of natural resources. Land-grabbing for plantation development, organised illegal logging, road and dam constructions and mining are overwhelming the already weak protected area management structures. Even areas until recently protected by their remoteness are under pressure. Over the last ten years several projects were set up by international organisations to strengthen biodiversity conservation in Cambodia, with varying success. Almost all of them were based in the lead agencies, aiming to increase capacity and strengthen oversight. While some of these measures were successful, it now becomes apparent that they fall short of guaranteeing the existence of protected areas in Cambodia. The contradicting or general lack of, land-use planning is creating conflicts between local people, \"developers\" and governments with the concept of a protected area being more and more eroded, losing its authority and meaning. It is becoming increasingly obvious that protected areas in Cambodia require a broader alliance of stakeholders to address these problems, which are beyond the capacity of an often marginalised line ministry.<br/><br/>The project is introducing an alternative approach, building on experiences made over the last ten years. It aims to make the commune the basic management unit for implementing protected area policies. The Cambodian government and donor agencies are taking steps towards general decentralization of government structures, delegating more authorities to the provincial and local level.  The Natural Resource Protection Group (NRPG) has been providing resources, training and capacity-building to local communities and commune councils in different parts of the country to take up greater responsibility for natural resource management in their areas. A more structural involvement of local stakeholders, beyond community forestry approaches, is the best chance to implement biodiversity conservation and protected area policies, since the local population is directly affecting the outcome of these policies in any scenario and furthermore, because land-use planning at the commune and district level has better chances for successful implementation than the non-transparent, contradicting allocations currently practised at the central level. Although the concept of integrating natural resources management into development plans at different levels in government is not new, the project aims to implement a more fundamental approach, going beyond informing and \"consulting\" local stakeholders and shifting real decision-making powers to the local level in line with the legal framework. Direct support for field activities conducted by local groups is a key component. <br/><br/>The project will increase oversight capacity of the commune councils. It introduces a set of measures at the commune level to enable local governments to take greater responsibility and address natural resources in their areas more effectively. In addition to general land-use planning, the focus is on capacity-building for monitoring and law enforcement related activities. Effective and \"fair\" enforcement of protected area regulations, forestry laws etc. is a crucial element to successfully shifting decision-making power to local structures. By demonstrating the ability to protect a resource within their boundaries, local communities, especially indigenous communities, can also claim a greater role and responsibility in managing and utilizing it in the future. <br/><br/>The project, jointly implemented by NRPG and the General Department of Administration for Nature Conservation and Protection (GDANCP), and has four components: the establishment of commune development plans for natural resources management as an agreed baseline including the introduction of new functions within commune councils; legal and technical training to enable the commune councils to take on this new role; practical training and equipment support for field activities; and a biodiversity value awareness campaign in the target communes.<br/><br/>Activities include legal reviews and outreach, development and dissemination of training materials and standardized procedures, field exercises and training workshops, patrol and documentation training, creation a designated stakeholder network, establishing of outposts and information centers, basic boundary demarcation, setting up of a conflict resolution mechanism, commune-based ecological surveys. The project will have a strong focus on field activities with NRPG participating in commune-based operations to provide technical and political support.<br/><br/>The overall goals of this initiative are to significantly reduce the degradation of two high-biodiversity areas and to pilot a new management structure which could provide a framework for potential future implementation of carbon, PES, ABS schemes. To enable greater benefit-sharing the project aims to increase the management capacity and awareness of biodiversity values amongst local communities, MoE staff and local government.<br/><br/>The project is designed as a pilot. As such it has two main areas of operations, the, so far, unprotected Prey Long forest block, particular its northern zone, and the Phnom Aural Wildlife Sanctuary, an area protected by Royal Decree since 1994. Both areas are under threat of severe degradation in the near to medium future and the differences in official protection status should help identifying key obstacles and opportunities for a commune based management model. NRPG has developed a network in both areas and has laid the groundwork to further develop this model. The feasibility and application of Indigenous and Community Conserved Area (ICCA) principles and structures will be tested.<br/><br/>In addition to the commune-based activities the project will facilitate the update and completion of the Protected Area GAP Analysis started by the World Bank supported Biodiversity and Protected Area Management Project (BPAMP).  An analysis of financial needs to implement the CBD programme on protected areas in Cambodia will also be conducted.",

		"ecological_contribution": "Project Area 1:<br/>The term Prey Long (or Prey Lang) has been used to refer to the extensive lowland dry evergreen and semi-evergreen forest landscape that is located between the Mekong and Stung Sen Rivers in northern Cambodia. It is centered upon the remnants of the original surface of the ancient alluvial plain that once extended across northern Cambodia but much of which has long been eroded away. This area supports roughly 3,600 square kilometers of forests. It measures roughly 120 km in its north-south axis from Kampong Cham province to the Laos border, and 30km in its east west axis from the Mekong River to the Stung Sen River. <br/><br/>Lowland dry evergreen forests dominate the central portions of the alluvial plain and are associated with the red-yellow podzol soils there. The forest grades through lowland semi-evergreen forest upon the grey hydromorphic soils to dry deciduous forests in more peripheral areas where they are associated with the less productive plinthite podzols and/or shallow lithosols soils.<br/><br/>In addition to the lowland dry evergreen, semi-evergreen and dry deciduous forests, this landscape also features a number of other forest communities. They include mixed dry deciduous forests dominated by Lagestroemia, short riparian and Melaleuca forests, short semi-evergreen forests, deciduous swamp forests and evergreen swamp forests.<br/><br/>Biodiversity Values<br/><br/>This heavily forested landscape has particularly high conservation values and sustainable use of biodiversity. These values stem from:<br/>• The largest of primary lowland dry evergreen forest remaining in both Cambodia and Indochina.<br/>• The existence of the range of critical and fragile habitats including swamp forests may act as repositories of ancient forest lineages.<br/>• The existence of healthy wildlife populations including endangered species such as elephants, gaur, banteng, tiger and Asiatic black bears as well as clouded leopards and rare turtle species.<br/> <br/>All of the forest types described here warrant some form of protection. This is particularly true for the lowland dry evergreen forests and the evergreen swamp forests.  These forests are rich in biodiversity and refuge rare species. Both of these forest types are quintessentially Cambodian in origin and character. The evergreen swamp forests appear to constitute an endemic forest formation that is endemic to Cambodia. <br/><br/>The lowland dry evergreen forests are distinctive from those on other lowland forests associated with the Cardamom and Elephant Ranges in the south-west, and the southern Annamites in the north east. It is also apparent that these forests maintain a level of biodiversity that equals or exceeds other lowland areas in Cambodia. The biological value of Prey Long seems all the more critical because most the Cambodia’s protected evergreen forests are located in or near mountainous regions (MacDonald 2004). These tall Dipterocarp forests of central Cambodia are of global significance, in that they represent a type of vegetation that was once formerly common throughout the whole of South East Asia but has largely been extirpated from the region.<br/><br/>Lowland dry evergreen forests on alluvial soils, especially those communities on the alluvial soils, have been subject to extensive logging during the last decade and remain particularly vulnerable to future logging. As a result of the extensive nature of these impacts only the core area of the Prey Long forest located within the upper catchments of the Stung Porong and O Long watercourses may be considered to be primary lowland dry evergreen forest (MacDonald 2005). Indeed, this forest now remains the largest patch of primary lowland dry evergreen forest within both Cambodia, and the entire Indochinese floristic province. This area lies within the unlogged portions of the former Colexim and Everbright concessions and was also untouched by logging operations in the 1960s. <br/><br/>The inclusion of roughly 80,000 to 100,000 hectares of unlogged or primary stands of this forest type places particular importance upon this focal area because this forest type has suffered heavy levels of deforestation and degradation throughout its range in the Indo-Chinese floristic province.<br/>These forests are habitat to wide diversity of Cambodia’s vascular plants including 11 threatened tree species and 19 of the 21 species prioritized for genetic conservation by the CTSP; as well as a diverse array of timber species. In addition, the area retains a range of key wildlife species including elephant, gaur, banteng, gibbons and hornbills. Although survey effort in this area is very limited it is already apparent that Prey Long features 16 to 22 threatened mammals, seven to 21 threatened birds and three to seven threatened reptiles. <br/><br/>Ecosystem Services<br/><br/>This forest landscape has particularly high social values. These derive from:<br/>• The large population living either within or peripheral to this landscape.<br/>• Its historical and current role as a provided of non-timber forest products to a large portion of the Cambodian population on a daily basis.<br/><br/>Over 250,000 people live in 339 villages that are largely located within the peripheral areas of this landscape. Villages are generally located along the larger streams and therefore around the periphery of the Prey Long forest although some recent settlements are the targeted areas that were relatively remote until recent years. A further 450,000 people live in 450 villages within ten kilometers of the boundary of this landscape. This landscape has a particular importance as it provides a livelihood for some ethnic minorities, notably the Kouy. It is also of great culture value for the Kouy.<br/><br/>While this area has been a focus for commercial timber extraction in its recent history, its principal utilitarian values appear to lie elsewhere. It has important watershed values. It is apparent that these forests have a broader significance in the water cycle within northern Cambodia as they play a critical role in provoking rains in central Cambodia and in maintaining water in the region throughout the year. Its extensive catchment area and deep soils constitute an important contribution to the maintenance of dry season flows. The role that both the lowland dry evergreen and swamp evergreen forests play in regulating water flows also serves to prevent sedimentation of the Tonle Sap lake.<br/><br/>These waters drain either directly to the Mekong or Stung Sen rivers, or to the Tonle Sap Lake via the Stung Chinit river. Thus, Prey Long contributes substantial waters to the agricultural areas on the floodplain of the Stung Sen River as well as those further downstream. The Stung Chinit river is also of particular importance because it directly supplies downstream agricultural areas in Kampong Thom province that are the focus of development efforts.<br/><br/>Prey Long also has important roles in the provision of non-timber forest products. It is a major source of tree resin within Cambodia. This resin is tapped in traditional manner from the large dipterocarp trees and sold to traders who sell in the domestic or export markets. Much of the resin is directly exported to Vietnam. The semi-evergreen forests are an important and traditional source of commercial bamboo harvests.<br/><br/>Perhaps the least well understood ecosystem service provided by Prey Long is that of carbon sequestration. The lowland dry evergreen forests appear to store more carbon that any other forest type in the country as they have perhaps the highest timber volumes and biomass of Cambodia’s forests when in an undisturbed state. They are therefore of particular importance to the consideration of Cambodia’s GHG emissions. The fact that much of the forest within this landscape has undergone heavy degradation adds additional importance to forest regeneration. If these degraded forest areas are allowed to regenerate this will result in the sequestration of very substantial amounts of carbon.<br/>A Protected Area System Gap Analysis conducted by the World Bank funded Biodiversity and Protected Areas Management Project (BPAMP) has identified the Prey Long forest as one of four areas of highest priority for additional protection measures.<br/><br/>Project Area 2:<br/>Phnom Aural was designated as a Wildlife Sanctuary by the 1993 Royal Decree on Protected Areas, at a time when the area was still contested by Khmer Rouge and government forces.  Its designation as a wildlife sanctuary reflected not only its high conservation value, but also the willingness of the government of the time to grant protected status to regions.<br/><br/>Phnom (Mount) Aural, Cambodia’s highest mountain, is a unique granite mountain that sits as an outlier of the main Cardamom Range in south-west Cambodia. This virtually symmetrical mountain represents an ancient volcano that has long been extinct though a few hot water pools persist in its hinterlands. There are relatively few villages in the districts associated with Phnom Aural. Here it tends to be limited to lowland areas associated with the larger streams originating from the mountain. There are no villages on the mountain slopes. <br/><br/>The mountain supports extensive lowland evergreen and sub-montane evergreen forests that are fringed by lowland semi-evergreen forests. Much of the surrounding hinterlands are comprised of the erosion products from the mountain and support deciduous forests and other more degraded vegetation. In recent years these deciduous forests still retained a high diversity of orchid species. The great height of this mountain has produced an altitudinal cline in the vegetation which changes in both structure (physiognomy) and composition as altitude increases. Sub-montane evergreen forests replace lowlands evergreen forests at about 700 masl. These are in turn replaced by shorter dwarf evergreen forests above 1,500 masl.<br/><br/>Biodiversity Values<br/><br/>This vulnerable jewel of the Cardamom Mountains is apparently one of the most biologically diverse sites in the country. It is expected to have a high level of national endemic plant species and still retains a range of key wildlife species including elephant, gaur, banteng, gibbons, and hornbills. These values stem from:<br/>• Its diversity of evergreen forest formations.<br/>• Its high elevation and uniqueness as the only large area of granite within the country.<br/>• The continuity with the extensive forest landscape of the Cardamom Mountains in South-west Cambodia.<br/><br/>Phnom Aural’s sub-montane forests have both a high national and international conservation significance as an important component the wider centre of plant diversity and endemism of the Cardamom Ranges. These ranges are believed to harbour about half of Cambodia’s known 214 endemic plant species as well as a substantial number of regionally endemic species (Dy Phon 1981, Rundel 1999). Furthermore, the dwarf evergreen forests formation growing on the poorer soils at high elevations are an endemic formation restricted to south-west Cambodia (Dy Phon 1981).<br/><br/>All of the forest types described here warrant some form of protection. This is particularly true for the evergreen forests on the mountain slopes.  These forests are rich in biodiversity and rare species. The dwarf evergreen swamp forests at higher altitudes appear to constitute a forest formation that is endemic to Cambodia. The lowland deciduous forests receive higher rainfall than those in other parts of the country and so may be richer in plant species diversity. This may be the explanation of their richness in orchids. <br/><br/>Phnom Aural’s forests appear to maintain a level of biodiversity that equals or exceeds other forest areas in Cambodia. This biological value seems all the more critical because most the uniqueness of the area’s geology and the increasing pressures upon its timber. In spite of these pressures, these forests are habitat to wide diversity of Cambodia’s vascular plants: probably more than in the lowland dry evergreen forests described above. Phnom Aural is habitat to between 23 and 33 threatened tree species. Fourteen of the 21 species prioritized for genetic conservation by the CTSP are found in nearby areas within the Cardamom Ranges. In addition, the area retains a range of key wildlife species including elephant, gaur, banteng, Eld's Deer, gibbons and hornbills. <br/><br/>Ecosystem Services<br/><br/>This forest landscape has particularly high social values. These derive from:<br/>• The large population living either within or peripheral to this landscape.<br/>• Its historical and current role as a provided of non-timber forest products to a large portion of the Cambodian population on a daily basis, particularly medicinal plants.<br/>• The regulation of water flows to extensive agricultural areas within Kampong Chhnang, Kampong Speu and Pursat provinces.<br/><br/>While the lowland deciduous and semi-evergreen forests have been a focus for illegal timber extraction in its recent history the principal utilitarian values of Phnom Aural lay elsewhere. Several of the country’s densely populated districts are contiguous with Phnom Aural. These support large populations and have received large numbers of migrants in recent years. Many people from nearby agricultural areas are dependent upon the forests as an economic “safety net” during the dry season.  This landscape has a particular importance as it provides a livelihood for some ethnic minorities, notably the Soui. It also includes sacred sites for the Soui, like a hotspring area south of Aural Mountain.<br/><br/>Phnom Aural has important watershed values for surrounding agricultural areas and the proposed dam on Prek Thnout watershed area to the south. It is likely that the forests play a supplementary role to that of the mountain itself in provoking rains in central Cambodia and in maintaining water in the region throughout the year. This extensive forested catchment area makes an important contribution to the maintenance of dry season flows and in reducing sedimentation in lowland areas. <br/><br/>These waters drain either directly to the Mekong River, Prek Thnout River or to the Tonle Sap. The Prek Thnout River is also of particular importance because it directly supplies downstream agricultural areas in Kampong Speu province that are the focus of development efforts.<br/><br/>Phnom Aural also has important roles in the provision of non-timber forest products. It is a major source of medicinal plant trade within Cambodia. A variety of plants are collected by villagers and laborers for both the domestic market and for export. Phnom Aural is one of the main sources for traditional medicines for the large diverse consumer market in Phnom Penh. <br/><br/>Phnom Aural also has an important role in carbon sequestration as it supports extensive evergreen forests. Indeed those at higher elevations are reportedly associated with highly organic soils that may also store substantial carbon reserves. The fact that degradation of forest within this landscape has largely been restricted to lowland deciduous forests augurs well for its carbon sequestration role. Nevertheless, the threat to forests on the mountain slopes have increased in recent years adds additional importance to forest protection. (cited: D. Ashwell et al, 2009)",

		"description": "Introduction<br/>East Timor is located in the Lesser Sunda Islands (part of the Australian continental plate), and includes the eastern end of the island of Timor, the Oecussi enclave in West Timor, and the islands of Atauro and Jaco. The total area encompassed is approximately 1,460,937 ha or 14,874 km2 (Sandlund et al., 2001).<br/>The total length is approximately 265 km, with a maximum width of 97 km. The bedrock is primarily sedimentary calcareous rock, with fossil coral reefs found at high altitudes (up to 2000 m) (Monk et al., 1997). Soils are generally thin, with poor water holding capacity (Carson, 1989). The topography is quite dramatic, with mountain peaks reaching as high as 2964 m. Steep slopes (incline over 40%) characterize as much as 44% of the total area (Monk et al, 1997). Lakes are relatively few and small, apart from the Iralalaru lake basin. Few of the approximately one hundred rivers flow regularly throughout the year. The largest river system (80 km in length) is the Lois River, on the north side of the mountains.  Climate varies greatly across East Timor. The South coast is “permanently moist” with more than 2000 mm of rain for 9 to 12 months per year. The northern part is “permanently dry” with rainfall of 500 to 1000 mm or more occurring in only four months or less. Hard torrential rain is common, with maximum daily rainfall recorded as high as 398 mm. This causes a high degree of surface runoff and increased soil erosion. The mean annual temperature at sea level is 27.5 o C and 19.8 o C at 1432 m above sea level (Keefer, 2000).<br/><br/>Natural Ecosystems<br/>East Timor contains six major ecosystem types (adapted from Sandlund et al., 2001). These are the:<br/>1. Marine and coastal zone<br/>2. Arid lowland areas<br/>3. Moist lowland areas<br/>4. Mountainous areas<br/>5. Highland plains<br/>6. Wetlands and lakes<br/><br/>Problems<br/>There are at least 6 major problems identified by the DPANP which are defined as major problems for developing the Protected Areas and National Park network in Timor-Leste, which also contribute to loss of biodiversity:<br/>1. No management system for protected areas (except NKSNP)<br/>2. Lack of alternative livelihoods for communities within protected areas and the national park; which leads to extensive shifting cultivation, resulting in the fragmentation and loss of forests and woodlands as they are converted to fields and agricultural land, and the unsuitable cultivation of steep hillsides, which results in sedimentation in aquatic habitats. In addition, illegal logging for high-value trees such as sandalwood and red wood is a major contributor to the degradation of forests and woodlands.<br/>3. Insufficient policies and laws on protected areas and national parks. There is only the UNTAET Regulation 2000/19 available which needs to be amended. The need for policies, laws and regulations, including enforcement of existing regulation, is urgent for the DPANP to work properly.    <br/>4. Lack of data, including GIS information for all protected areas; <br/>5. Lack of human capacity (skills and number of staff) and<br/>6. Lack of funding to develop 30 protected areas",

These include all species listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendices I and II, including sea turtles, marine mammals, wallabies, and crocodiles. The majority of East Timor’s endangered species, and much of its biodiversity are found in its remaining forests.

WCS’s latest great ape surveys described some of the highest known densities of gorillas in Africa and Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park is a key protected area in the landscape that harbors the recently reported population of 125,000 gorillas. The park is also home to some of the last populations of “naïve” chimpanzees which reside in the Goualouago Triangle and display a certain curiosity towards human observers encountering them for the first time.<br/>     For the last 18 years the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Congolese Ministry of Forestry Economy (MEF) have forged a partnership through the Nouabalé-Ndoki Project and jointly manage the Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park. The principle goal of the Nouabalé-Ndoki Project is to effectively protect the biodiversity of the Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park through a site-based, landscape management approach, in collaboration with the buffer zones (PROGEPP) and contiguous protected areas in the region (Sangha River Trinational). Key site-based activities, in addition to law enforcement, include biological monitoring, research, training education and awareness raising, and eco-tourism development.  The program uses the ecological needs of and threats to a complementary suite of wide-ranging landscape species to efficiently target conservation efforts, and research and monitoring programs currently being conducted within the national park enable project management to evaluate the success of their conservation efforts in terms of meeting these needs and mitigating the threats. <br/>     Capacity building is an important element of this effort, and WCS personnel within the project work closely with: a) staff from MFEE responsible for wildlife protection and Park management, b) local and regional stakeholders in the landscape, and c) Congolese graduates (as both research assistants and administrators) to develop national capacity for natural resource management. <br/>     The Nouabalé-Ndoki Project also serves as a platform for protected area Policy development. Project staff worked closely with government, trinational and NGO partners to help develop the Sangha Trinational Trust Fund, which was launched in March 2007. This is the first such initiative in the region, and will provide stable, long-term funding for the management of the region’s protected areas. Nouabalé-Ndoki project staff have also worked to develop alternative funding strategies such as ecotourism, and steps are being taken in association with WCS’ Conservation Finance Program to develop private sector partnerships with tour operators that are willing to invest in tourism development at the site.<br/>     WCS is also developing a wildlife-human health program including the construction and operation of a laboratory in Bomassa.  This program and laboratory involves multiple collaborations with analyses and research shared between CIRMF laboratory in Gabon, the Robert Koch Institute in Germany and other international and national institutions collaborating is the Great Ape Health monitoring efforts. A strong cooperation with the Government of Congo’s Ministry of Health is being developed regarding Ebola issues and WCS is working with international collaborators to develop a vaccine and strategy that will protect great apes in and around the Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park.",

		"ecological_contribution": "The Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park (NNNP; 4,200 km2) is located in the northern part of the Republic of Congo (RC). NNNP was created in 1993 in response to the critical biological significance and outstanding levels of biodiversity of the area,  including the endangered western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), chimpanzee (Pan troglodyates troglodytes), forest elephant (Loxodanta africana cyclotis), bongo (Tragelophus euryceros), buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus), and leopard (Panthera pardus). Now considered as an area of exceptional regional and international importance, the NNNP, together with the Lobéké (Cameroon), and Dzanga-Ndoki National Parks (Central African Republic), forms part of the trans-boundary Sangha Tri-National complex (TNS), one of the most pristine blocks of protected tropical lowland forest in Central Africa (covering an area of over 25,000 km2). The TNS is not only one of the most important areas for biodiversity conservation, it also harbors one of the largest remaining populations of great apes in Africa. The fact that the TNS great ape exceptional priority area overlaps with a priority biodiversity landscape emphasizes the importance of apes as flagships for the forests they inhabit. <br/>The TNS, representative of the Congo Basin eco-region, is recognized as a global priority landscape by the government of Congo, WCS, the CARPE Congo Basin Forest Partnership (CBFP), the 2000 Libreville biodiversity vision workshop, and is among the seven exceptional priority areas in the regional action plan for the conservation of chimpanzees and gorillas in western equatorial Africa (Tutin et. al., 2005). The NNNP remains an intact forest ecosystem free of human disturbance or exploitation, with important populations of endangered great apes and other large mammals and more than 400 species of birds. <br/>In December 2000, an official accord was signed by all the three countries, members’ states of TNS, solidifying the commitment to collaborate in the management of this area. In early 2010h the governments of Congo, CAR and Cameroun submitted the TNS, including NNNP to the UNESCO World Heritage Center to be listed as a World Heritage Site because of its unique and exceptional value.",

The main goal of the project is to strengthen the participation of local communities in the management of the protected area, thus ensuring more effective conservation of the natural resources and ecosystems in the area. Additionally, the project seeks to contribute to the preservation of highly endangered gorilla species in support of the ECOFAC conservation program in the Odzala-Kokoua National Park.",
		"description": "The Odzala-Kokoua National Park (OKNP) is located in the Congo Basin and is the second largest rainforest in the world after the Amazon. The Lossi Reserve of Fauna is a community-based conservation satellite of Odzala-Kokoua National Park, which aims to strengthen the participation of local communities in the preservation of natural resources and environment. The research program was complemented by the study of two focal gorilla groups to develop a pilot experience of “western lowland gorilla viewing” to support the ECOFAC conservation program in the Odzala-Kokoua National Park. The initiative creates an experience of a pioneer community-based conservation in central Africa. The Lossi Reserve (LR) was officially decreed in 2001, and becomes the first step to give local communities the authority of co-management of natural resources.<br/>This valuable experience was partially truncated by the epidemics of the Ebola virus in the region. The area has undergone at least three outbreaks of Ebola virus between 2002 and 2005; the latest hit OKNP. The study of the outbreaks impact and the mechanisms of disease transmission in the population of gorillas and chimpanzees have been complemented with the study of potential control measures (Research collaboration: University of Barcelona, CIRMF, WCS veterinary team, Max Planck, University of Rennes). At present, there is an “important” gorilla and chimpanzee populations non-affected by the epidemic located near human settlements in the interzone between OKNP and LR protected areas. These forests are currently dominated by logging concessions, however, and thus Ebola-orientated activities need to be accompanied by effective law enforcement and strategic zoning plans in order to protect remaining populations from poaching. (See attached document Bermejo LifeWeb Application Project Odzala-Lossi) <br/>Project challenges:<br/>1) Develop conservation enterprises that benefit local communities to increase connectivity between landscapes, ecosystems, habitats and maintenance of biodiversity and ecological processes; 2) Sponsor education and training for current and future protected areas scientists and staff; 3) Strengthen Lossi community-based conservation area, and its periphery at legal, policy, financial, institutional and community levels. 4) Work with governments to facilitate the official and effective management of the Odzala-Kokoua and Lossi Interzone considering local, national and international values, and support conservation policy;  <br/>5) Develop a regional platform (College of Central Africa Tracking Expertise) to preserve an endangered technique in central Africa. The “master” trackers performance will be a strong support for the studies of animal populations to establish the fluctuations in the number of individuals of a particular species, the stability of communities, the factors that affect it, and the influence of a particular component within a community. The education program will as well implement a skills-training project through a non-formal adult education programme following a participatory approach research. In the preliminary courses, the master trackers had began their training as Evaluators/Educators at international scale.

There is high overlap between priority areas for great apes and priority areas for biodiversity in general.

Over the past three years, this region has experienced at least three outbreaks of Ebola threatening great ape populations within the OKNP, and the LR. Urgent attention needs to be focused on the epidemiology of this outbreaks and their likely impact on great ape populations, complemented by targeted research into potential control measures. In all likelihood, substantial ape populations still remain in the peripheral Ngombe, Ntokou and Pikounda forests. However, these forests are currently dominated by logging concessions, and thus Ebola-orientated activities need to be accompanied by effective law enforcement and strategic zoning plans in order to protect remaining populations from poaching.

		"description": "The Malpelo Fauna and Flora Sanctuary (MMFS), located 490 km west from the Colombian Tropical Pacific coast and declared a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site in July 2006 is home to incredible biodiversity. Moreover, the MMFS is included in the first Conservation Marine Corridor (CMAR) of the Eastern Tropical Pacific, a transregional marine area which is integrating a complex of Islands from different countries (see Figure 3) and considered as one of the most productive areas of the Eastern Tropical Pacific and one of the biogeographical provinces with a very high of endemism in the world. Then, the MMFS has an important ecological interconnection level and complex oceanographic properties, given mainly to the multiple marine convergence currents, which facilitates the dispersion of marine larvae, affecting migrations, movements and distribution of many regionally and globally important species. Specifically, the MMFS includes: a high endemism level with, until date, 4 terrestrial and 5 marine species exclusively found in the Sanctuary; the largest nesting population of Nazca booby in the world with an estimated number of 100.000 individuals; 14 different species of sharks, seven of which have been nationally and internationally recognized as vulnerable, and one of which (the Scalloped Hammerhead Shark), is on the IUCN endangered species list; and a total of 1315 species reported until date.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as the MMFS provides a significant aggregation site for feeding, cleaning, mating and resting for numerous species of sea life along their Pacific migration routes, these species have been increasingly threatened by illegal fishing in the Protected Area (PA), unsustainable fishing in the Corridor, and more specifically by the shark fining industry which has become a growing fishery target for local coastal communities, whose traditional fishing resources have diminished. This former threat to biodiversity, is not the only one which is affecting the equilibrium of the MMFS and, is taking part of an entire problematic which include also: threats from non-native species that have harmful effects on biodiversity following their introduction in the Island; threats from unadvised tourism which is leaving a substantial footprint in the local ecosystem (this threat is currently being managed but continuing work is necessary) ; threats from the lack of management of sewage system and rubbish treatment in the Island; and threats originated by the weakness of environmental awareness in local communities.<br/><br/>Despite the enormous efforts made to date, the MFFS still has conservation gaps that must be addressed if the desired ecological representation is to be achieved. The strategic and thematic lines of intervention for strengthening this marine protected area are aimed to strengthen the mechanisms and planning tools, management and coordination of the PA, based on the results of biological monitoring and administration; local participation and socioeconomic development; the professionalization and implementation of services ; and PA management capacity building. This program will be established by strengthening the enforcement of the Sanctuary Management Plan (see attached document, 1.Management Plan) and the main challenges to be addressed by the project will be:<br/><br/>-Improving implementation and effective monitoring of the PA. -Updating and improving information management tools. -Promoting sustainable fisheries and tourism. -Increasing and improving control and surveillance of the PA. -Capacitating Coastguard teams and tourism operators on alien species introduction prevention, MMFS biological values and PA policy. -Promoting at local, national and regional levels, awareness and active involvement of local communities and Protected Areas stakeholders.",

The introduction of the National Navy in control and surveillance processes, as well as the introduction of more stringent legislation to support their overall management is therefore absolutely necessary to ensure that such situations are curtailed. Currently, the Malpelo Foundation in collaboration with other organizations and environmental Authorities is promotting  the adoption by the  Colombian Congress of the National Action Plan for Sharks, rays and chimeras (see attached document, 2. PAN Tiburon).<br/><br/>Another serious threat is about invasive /alien species. Indeed, MMFS is not protected from invasive species brought by tourism and Coastguard teams and those introductions can cause a dramatic decline in the species populations that are living in the Island. Protocols against the introduction of invasive species will be designed and training to protected area stakeholders will be achieved.  <br/><br/>A specific monitoring and research program will be developed and implemented to produce information to raise national and international public and scientific awareness and inform decisions about the effects of climate change.<br/><br/>Social participation will continue to be an integral part of the evaluation of management effectiveness at the MFFS through an internationally validated and recognized tool, the AEMAPPS (Analysis of Effectiveness of Protected Areas Management) which at date is in course of application (see attached document, 3.

The tool will inform adaptive management decisions, reveal improvements in reaching conservation goals and increase governance in the National Protected Areas System.<br/><br/>All relevant information about the project progress and results will be efficiently made public through the communications strategy of the Malpelo Foundation and the National Parks Authority at local, regional, national and international levels, advancing in raising consciousness and awareness about the values, status and conservation needs of the PA, and promoting active involvement of private and public, national and international stakeholders.",

Main objective of the SINAP is to develop an in situ conservation policy, with broad participation of social and institutional actors. The Colombian National Parks Unit has enacted a policy of social participation in conservation, which claims that every action in a protected area is backed by labor, competition and decisions of those who benefit of the resources of the protected area (see attached document, 6. SINAP).<br/><br/>From this legal and policy perspective, the project will generate mechanisms of participation that are aimed at issues such as:<br/><br/>1. Joint management of the MMFS protected area.<br/>2. Spaces for participation by afro Colombian local groups*.<br/>3. Design of aquaculture projects with local stakeholders and fisherman communities as economic alternatives.<br/>4. Use of the “Analysis of Protected Areas Management Effectiveness” (AEMAPPS) tool which includes many participation instruments.<br/><br/>*By conducting groups of artisanal fishermen to Malpelo, during scientific expeditions, to show them the biological significance of the Sanctuary and involve them in the fishery problematic, we are promoting an unusual and interesting initiative that permits the integration of fisherman local communities in the promotion and management of the protected area.",

Then, the MMFS has an important ecological interconnection level and complex oceanographic properties, given mainly to the multiple marine convergence currents, which facilitates the dispersion of marine larvae, affecting migrations, movements and distribution of many regionally and globally important species. Specifically, the MMFS includes: a high endemism level with, until date, 4 terrestrial and 5 marine species exclusively found in the Sanctuary; the largest nesting population of Nazca booby in the world with an estimated number of 100.000 individuals; 14 different species of sharks, seven of which have been nationally and internationally recognized as vulnerable, and one of which (the Scalloped Hammerhead Shark), is on the IUCN endangered species list; and a total of 1315 species reported until date.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as the MMFS provides a significant aggregation site for feeding, cleaning, mating and resting for numerous species of sea life along their Pacific migration routes, these species have been increasingly threatened by illegal fishing in the Protected Area (PA), unsustainable fishing in the Corridor, and more specifically by the shark fining industry which has become a growing fishery target for local coastal communities, whose traditional fishing resources have diminished. This former threat to biodiversity, is not the only one which is affecting the equilibrium of the MMFS and, is taking part of an entire problematic which include also: threats from non-native species that have harmful effects on biodiversity following their introduction in the Island; threats from unadvised tourism which is leaving a substantial footprint in the local ecosystem (this threat is currently being managed but continuing work is necessary) ; threats from the lack of management of sewage system and rubbish treatment in the Island; and threats originated by the weakness of environmental awareness in local communities.<br/><br/>Despite the enormous efforts made to date, the MFFS still has conservation gaps that must be addressed if the desired ecological representation is to be achieved.

		"summary": "This project will provide greater capacity at the local level to harmonise management interventions, develop effective communication strategies, and enable a broad spectrum of social and natural sciences research and monitoring activities in the Sulu Sulawesi Network of marine protected areas. The project will be strongly based on scientific and historic aspects of biodiversity encompassed within the Network of protected areas. At the same time, the strengthened capacity to effectively manage the protected areas, develop private-public partnerships to promote ecotourism, and carry out activities related to climate change adaptation and mitigation will safeguard livelihoods and culture across a wide geographical range. The project will design and adopt sustainable financing and business plans for the Network of protected areas, based on financing options that will consider payments for ecosystem services, such as business and biodiversity carbon offsets.",
		"description": "The Sulu-Sulawesi marine eco-region is home to approximately one million people and provides income for over 30 million people at a greater regional level, with over one billion USD generated annually through extractive coastal fisheries. Tourism is the second largest revenue earner, particularly the ecologically-based, wildlife and seascape-dependent sectors. This marine region supports approximately 600 species of corals, over 1200 species of fish and most importantly five of the world’s seven species of sea turtles – the green, hawksbill, loggerhead, olive ridley and leatherback. Of these, the green and hawksbill turtles are by far the most abundant, with significant nesting and foraging assemblages. The region is also home to the endangered large herbivorous mammal, the dugong. The network of protected areas is situated at the western extreme of the Coral Triangle, creating suitable bio-geographical conditions within the region for maintenance and regulation of productivity in light of future impacts of climate change, making it one of the most important marine regions in the world.<br/><br/>Marine resources in the Sulu-Salawesi Seascape (SSS) are threatened through exhaustive fisheries, extensive and illegal unreported harvests of endangered species (including direct poaching of adults for the meat and curio trades – an alarmingly emerging trade link to China and Vietnam), habitat loss and degradation resulting from anthropogenic impacts and climate change, and coastal development. Recent estimates from Sabah alone demonstrate an annual by-catch of turtles of approximately >1000 turtles per annum. Importantly, livelihoods are threatened by decreasing returns in fisheries, impacted ecosystems and a loss of resiliency to climate change impacts.<br/><br/>Over the past several years concerted efforts have been made by the proposing project partners to substantially advance the conservation agenda in the SSS eco-region, resulting in the development of joint enforcement agreements and sustained monitoring and research activities. These activities have promoted cultural exchanges and capacity-building opportunities, and have introduced sustainable fishery methods in a limited geographical context. They have been supported by the Protected Areas Wildlife Bureau (DENR), WWF – Philippines, Conservation international – Philippines Sulu-Sulawesi Seascape Project, Sabah Parks, the National Plans of Action (NPOA) in the Philippines and Malaysia, and the Marine Research Foundation’s marine turtle programme, amongst others. Institutionally, regional conservation initiatives are enabled through the Turtle Islands Heritage Protected Area, the Coral Triangle Initiative RPOA, the Sulu-Sulawesi Marine Eco-region programme, BIMP-EAGA and the Joint Commission on Border Control. With the sheer number of people impacted by the declining environmental health and ecosystem values represented by the networked areas, the time is ripe for building on the successes of the past and promoting conservation of biological diversity through enhanced protected area networking. <br/> <br/>There is a pressing need for support to strengthen the management capacity of local authorities and communities, and to promote the management and understanding of biological resources based on a strong foundation of science and natural history. Protecting one aspect of a resource’s life cycle only to see it depleted elsewhere is counterproductive, much like unproductive farming. Indeed, the current network of protected areas, which has been developed for the Sulu Sulawesi and endorsed by the Tri-National Committee, was entirely designed based on the natural history of its biological resources, rather than management or convenience factors. <br/><br/>The benefits of this project will lead to greater conservation financing, improved protection of natural resources, sustainable resource utilisation, improved community well-being through jobs creation, improved living conditions (social infrastructure) and poverty alleviation. The project aims to increase government investment in the networked protected areas, to be a showcase for effective conservation and development through non-consumptive uses, and to improve security conditions in the region.",

The mountains, jungles, rivers, lakes, and seas form one of the biggest biodiversity pools in the world, and all ASEAN States are signatories to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which calls for “a significant reduction of current rate of biodiversity loss at the global, regional and national levels as a contribution to poverty alleviation and to the benefit of all life on earth.” The CBD also indicates that Protected Areas (PAs) are among the “best” means to achieve the 2010 biodiversity targets and sets a target for comprehensive, effectively managed, and ecologically representative national and regional systems of protected areas that collectively, through a global network, contribute to achieving the global targets. This project supports this initiative directly. It addresses seagrass beds, coral reefs, mangroves and other marine ecosystems in support of this diverse habitat approach.<br/><br/>The network of sites prioritised herein is identified in the Malaysia and Philippines Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) NPOAs and the CTI RPOA.

We argue that in the absence of reefs all of this carbon would be released into the atmosphere, and that reefs act as an important geological buffer to the earth’s climate. The project will also investigate ways to contribute to the Blue Carbon Initiative, taking into account that resilient marine ecosystems do not only play a crucial role in binding carbon, but also contribute to economic development, food security, social wellbeing, and provide important buffers against pollution, and extreme weather events."

		"ecological_contribution": "NIPAS system-wide Ecological Gap Assessment and Priority Setting to date:<br/>For the past ten years, the Philippine Hotspot has undergone a series of ecological assessments to determine the adequacy of existing protected area system and over-all biodiversity conservation initiatives. Spearheaded by the Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (PAWB-DENR) together with Conservation International (CI) and the University of the Philippines, the Philippine Biodiversity Conservation Priority-Setting Program (PBCPP) was completed in 2002 with 170 Terrestrial and 36 Marine Conservation Priority Areas (CPAs) delineated.  The priority areas were identified based on combined experience of experts making the best use of available data and the consensus of the different thematic groups (plants, arthropods, herps, birds, mammals, inland waters and socio-economic).  Although it was a critical and successful first step in identifying priority conservation sites in the country, many of the resulting priority areas were very large, and proved to be not practical from a manageability and funding availability perspective.  Moreover, the priority areas lacked the quantitative data showing presence of target species for immediate action.  <br/><br/>By identifying the Important Bird Areas (IBAs), Haribon Foundation and Birdlife International addressed the need for extensive data collection whilst going through the process of reviewing and spatially referencing all relevant existing information on birds to identify Key Conservation Sites. To address the shortcomings of the PBCPP, PAWB-DENR together with CI Philippines and Haribon Foundation began the process of applying the IBA framework for other taxonomic groups to refine the PBCPP priority areas into manageable areas or “Key Biodiversity Areas”.  <br/><br/>The Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) are sites that encompass habitat critical to the survival of globally threatened and geographically concentrated species.  The identification of KBAs follows strict criteria followed world-wide based on the presence of viable populations of species requiring urgent conservation action. The fundamental criteria for identifying key biodiversity areas which we have used are:<br/>1.\tvulnerability - defined as those that support geographically concentrated species; and<br/>2.\tirreplaceability - defined as those that support the regular presence of significant numbers of one or more globally threatened species.<br/><br/>Emerging Conservation Priorities:<br/>Using the two criteria, 128 Key Biodiversity Areas have been identified for the Philippines.  One hundred and nineteen (119) KBAs overlaps with one or more CPAs and eight KBAs have been identified outside of the CPAs. <br/><br/>Out of the 109 protected areas (PAs) established under NIPAS as of 2009, only 61 PAs overlap with 52 KBAs. This means that only 41% of the KBAs benefit from official safeguard status in the Philippines. The remaining 76 KBAs (59%) lack formal government protection. In addition, 51 sites were identified as Candidate KBAs or research priorities based on historical data or habitat suitability. They are priority for field validation to determine the presence of the target species that will trigger the designation of such areas as KBAs.  <br/><br/><br/>System-wide Programmatic Priorities:<br/><br/>Typically, the approach for establishing the baseline and then advancing in each of these areas can be summarized as follows:<br/><br/>Element 1: Ecologically representative: Continue national ecological gap assessment taking off from the KBA initiative. <br/>As outlined above, activities completed under the national ecological gap assessment include:<br/>a.\tAssemble taxonomy of all key national ecological habitats, and of all classes of national protected areas (e.g. IUCN classes 1 through VI)<br/>b.\tAssemble all existing data on national habitat distribution and National protected area boundaries, compile into compatible GIS data layers<br/>c.\tObtain / create data layers for missing habitats, protected areas, etc.<br/>d.\tCreate master national mapping system of national habitats and protected areas coverage<br/>e.\tAnalyze for representation of major habitats in national protected areas system<br/>The following documents are included as addendums in support of above accomplishments:<br/>1.\tAddendum B. Map showing the protected areas in the country including their classifications <br/>2.\tAddendum C. The KBA Process<br/>3.\tAddendum D. Key Biodiversity Areas in the Philippines<br/>4.\tAddendum E. KBA/NIPAS overlay including a list of KBAs not included in the NIPAS<br/>5.\tAddendum F. Republic Act 7586 – An Act providing the establishment and management of National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS), defining its scope and coverage, and for other purposes<br/>6.\tAddendum G. DENR Memorandum Circular 2004-09 –Amending DMC 35 series of 1993 re: Criteria and Guidelines for Categorization of Protected Areas under the NIPAS<br/>7.\tAddendum H. Republic Act No. 9147 – An Act Providing for the conservation and protection of wildlife resources and their habitats, appropriating funds therefore and for other purposes (Wildlife Act).<br/>8.\tAddendum I. Memorandum Circular 2007-02: Guidelines on the establishment and management of Critical Habitats<br/>Activities still to be completed include:<br/>f.\tAnalyze the ecosystem services benefits of different current and potential protected areas (carbon sequestration, climate adaptation, freshwater management, etc.)<br/>g.\tEstablish meaningful national targets for biodiversity habitat protection, ecosystem service protection and climate mitigation & management for the national protected areas system<br/>h.\tPrioritize management of current and creation of new protected areas to achieve representative national targets for protected areas system with strengthened ecosystem services values to the national economy <br/>i.\tIdentify Protected Areas for disestablishment under NIPAS for transition to a new management regime<br/>j.\tConduct further ecological studies within candidate KBAs to determine its eligibility as an important conservation area that necessitates formal protection <br/>Thus, under program element 1, this project seeks to provide funding for the conservation and protection of KBAs that are not covered by the current protected area system. In line with the country’s commitment to the CBD’s Program of Work for Protected Areas (POWPA), activities f - j. will be completed: a selection process and criteria identification will be undertaken to prioritize KBAs that need to be declared as a protected area under the National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS). This will be part of the key milestones in the national strategic protected area plan for the Philippine Hotspot to be developed under this project. <br/><br/>Element 2: Effectively managed: Conduct a national management effectiveness assessment.<br/>a.\tSelect a consistent management effectiveness assessment tool for protected areas and a service provider who can implement it or assist local protected areas staff to implement it<br/>b.\tSelect a representative sample of protected areas to conduct the assessments<br/>c.\tConduct the assessments to understand the standard of management and governance across the national protected areas system<br/>d.\tCompile the findings, and analyze to establish the overall strengths and weaknesses of the capacity and management effectiveness of the national protected areas agency<br/>e.\tDevelop a capacity action plan to address the key areas requiring strengthening to secure the biodiversity, ecosystem service protection and climate mitigation & management objectives<br/>f.\tDesign and implement a program to strengthen targeted management and governance capacities <br/>Element 3:  Supported by key stakeholders and communities: Conduct a national protected areas system stakeholder engagement assessment followed by suitable interventions:<br/>a.\tFor a sample of key national protected areas system sites, assess the level of community knowledge, attitudes, engagement  and behaviors toward the protected areas and their key conservation objectives,<br/>b.\tDesign and implement a series of social marketing campaigns and governance and management capacity building interventions at these sites to engage stakeholders and build support and engagement of these communities in the protection and management of the protected areas. Strengthen access, benefit sharing and participation of local and indigenous communities in the Protected Area Governance to support the sustained achievement of national protected areas’ biodiversity, economic, cultural and climate benefits.<br/>Element 4: Sustainably funded: Conduct a national sustainable funding assessment:<br/>a.\tCompile existing budget and funding data for the national protected area system and a suitable sample of its individual component protected areas<br/>b.\tEstimate the overall cost centers and therefore budget needed annually to fund the protected areas system at differing levels of management effectiveness (status quo, low and high levels of effectiveness)<br/>c.\tAnalyze the adequacy and levels and diversity of current funding sources for the national protected areas system in comparison to the actual and alternative desired funding levels, determine funding “gap”<br/>d.\tConduct high-level analysis of the economic value and contribution of national protected areas system<br/>e.\tAnalyze key economic factors to propose alternative potential new funding mechanisms for further investigation (e.g. increased national budget allocations, introduction of fees, development of ecotourism, sale of carbon credits, etc.)<br/>Element 5: Managed for climate adaptation and mitigation: Imbue work streams 1 – 4 above with climate analysis and expertise to:<br/>a.\tUnderstand the carbon sequestration and storage, and climate adaptation value and potential of both the national protected areas system and key protected areas within the system<br/>b.\tTarget the expansion of ecological representation of national protected areas system, its management, governance & engagement and funding so as to maximize those benefits, for example by enhancing connectivity and adequate protected area buffer zones.",

		"participation": "•\tGender Equity:  The community PA governance work undertaken through this program will engage all segments of the local population. Further, the role of PAs on food security noted above often greatly affects women in their role as providers of food for the family and often as vendors of forest products harvested, fish and seafood, as well as supporting food sources for the most marginalized community members. This project recognizes important differences in how women and men use, manage, and conserve biological resources. Program planning integrates the understanding of gender-based differences and their implications for natural resources management and biodiversity conservation into conservation programs and policies. By giving women a clear role in biodiversity decision-making, the social acceptability and sustainability of Protected Area conservation and management efforts can be enhanced. Involving women is often the most effective avenue for generating behavioural change. Women and children are often the ones found gleaning in the buffer zones Marine Protected Areas and harvesting non-timber forest products in terrestrial protected areas around the country.<br/><br/>•\tCultural and spiritual access: By engaging local communities in the planning and management of their protected areas, especially under proposed program element 3 (stakeholder engagement, access and benefit sharing) the process of this project will capture and account for community, cultural and spiritual associations with their protected land and sea-scapes.",

The gap assessment and strategic plan will guide the future growth and institutional development of both the national protected areas agency (Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau - PAWB) and its component protected areas, thereby advancing the security of the manifold economic and social benefits that the national protected areas system provides to humanity.",
					"description": "The CBD Programme of Work on Protected Areas (POWPA) essentially provides the following framework for advancing the effectiveness of a national system of protected areas. A national system and its component protected area sites should strive to be:<br/>1.\tEcologically representative: Broadly, the national PA system covers adequate proportions of the nation’s (and neighbouring trans-boundaries) that cover various biodiversity and habitat types;<br/>2.\tEffectively managed: The management capacity of institutions at the national agency and local protected area level is sufficient for the protected areas system to meet its conservation and other objectives, and to yield its social, economic, climate management and biodiversity benefits for society.<br/>3.\tSupported by key stakeholders and communities: The national population understands and supports the mission of the national protected areas system and its component sites. Communities surrounding and within individual protected areas understand the value of those protected areas, are engaged in their management, and perceive themselves to have adequate access, benefits sharing and participation in the protected areas.<br/>4.\tSustainably funded: The economic, social and climate benefits of the National Protected Areas system are understood and the national protected areas agency and system has adequate, diverse sustainable funding to meet its objectives and to secure those benefits.<br/>5.\tManaged for climate adaptation and mitigation: Since the original POWPA was ratified in 2004, the global protected areas community has come to recognize that the above four themes should be implemented so that they maximize the value of individual protected areas and systems of protected areas in sequestering and storing carbon and in supporting the adaptation of communities and economies to the likely impact of climate change through enhancing the resiliency of ecosystem services provided by protected habitats.  Thus, a thorough understanding of the inter-relationship between biodiversity protection and climate change adaptation and mitigation should be imbued into any protected areas system planning and management program.<br/>According to national commitments to the POWPA, each national protected areas agency should know the status of each of these four elements and have a plan to strengthen each of them to an adequate level.

One of the most crucial problems of the park is the management of a buffer zone where communities in the vicinities can access natural resources in a controlled manner, to guarantee their participation in the effort of conservation. The high altitude zone of the Kahuzi-Biega National Park is surrounded by a high population density, and all forests surrounding this part of the park have been converted to agriculture and ranching. A strong pressure is now exerted on the park’s forests.

Toutes les forêts autour de cette partie du parc ont cédé à l’agriculture et l’élevage. Une forte pression est exercée sur la seule forêt qui reste. Depuis 1985, le parc expérimente l’approche de conservation communautaire où 13 comités de conservation communautaires se sont constitués dans ses environs en vue de contribuer à la conservation des ressources naturelles (RN) et au développement de leur milieu. Avec l’appui du parc, ils ont élaboré des plans villageois de développement dans lequel ils ont demandé comme ressources alternatives le reboisement intensif de leurs collines dénudées, dans le but de  lutter contre les érosions intempestives et d’éviter de détruire la forêt du parc par la recherche  du bois de chauffe dans celui-ci. Une étude conjointe du reboisement intensif  a été faite il y a trois ans avec les communautés concernées de 4 groupements autour du parc.

Despite the presence of a host of endangered and endemic species, biodiversity is under increasing threat from a number of human activities. This project aims to protect both highland and lowland corridors in the Cross River Gorilla landscape in order to effectively manage unprotected forests, and the ecosystem services they provide, thus securing local livelihoods and preserving important carbon sinks.",
		"description": "The Project area falls within the 4,300km2 Takamanda-Mone Technical Operations Unit (TOU), a government land-use classification established to help with land-use planning for conservation and development. Within the TOU, three protected areas exist, the 676km2 Takamanda National Park, created in 2008; the 538km2 Mone Forest Reserve, created in 1951 and the 19.4km2 Kagwene Gorilla Sanctuary, created in 2008.<br/><br/>The Gulf of Guinea is an area of known high biodiversity importance, and the Takamanda-Mone landscape is typical of this. Important large mammal species found in the forests of this region include a unique sub-species of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes ellioti), the drill (Mandrillus leucophaeus) and the world’s most endangered species of gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli). Biodiversity amongst other taxa is equally high and the region also has some of the highest levels of plant diversity in Africa and forest cover remains largely intact across the landscape.<br/><br/>Despite the presence of a host of endangered and endemic species, biodiversity is under increasing threat from a number of human activities. Commercial bush-meat hunting is pervasive and is leading to local extinctions in many forest areas. The introduction of guns has had a big impact on large mammal populations, but indiscriminate snaring is also of serious concern. Some animals, notably the great apes, are still hunted for traditional and medicinal reasons as well.<br/><br/>Habitat conversion due to expanding agriculture (and the preference for slash and burn), and as a result of grassland burning is also fragmenting the forest area. Access to the Takamanda-Mone landscape remains limited, but as seasonal roads are improved, the degree of deforestation and degradation is set to increase dramatically.<br/><br/>Due to poor road access and limited alternative employment opportunities, most local communities are highly forest dependent. Unfortunately, population pressure and the market demand for many forest resources in nearby Nigeria is encouraging many communities to allow outsiders to harvest various forest products unsustainably in return for token payments. A well organised trans-boundary trade in illegal timber, bush-meat and many other non-timber forest products exists and needs to be brought under control.<br/><br/>In the long term it is also essential that habitat connectivity be maintained and managed between core protected areas within the landscape if true landscape species such as the forest elephant and Cross River gorilla are to survive. The need to protect both highland and lowland corridors is important. If unprotected forests are not managed in some way, essential ecosystem services for local livelihoods (NTFPs, watershed protection, etc.) will also be lost, and huge amounts of carbon (up to 400t/ha) released. <br/><br/> Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) is emerging as an effective strategy for concurrently mitigating negative impacts of climate changes while conserving large tracts of forest. <br/><br/>To be globally effective, REDD must be implemented at spatial scales greater than individual protected areas and project sites, and at timescales that go beyond individual project cycles in order to address the long-term drivers of deforestation. This will require planning the implementation of different types of emissions reduction activities (such as Improved Forest Management, Avoided Planned Deforestation, Avoided Unplanned Deforestation, etc.) as well as afforestation (in the form of agroforestry, etc.) in a spatially coherent way that takes full account of local development needs.  Integrating REDD into planning at the landscape scale is a formidable challenge, but is the only way in which opportunity costs and leakage risks can be truly controlled and thereby ensure sustainability. <br/><br/>The Cross River Gorilla Landscape provides an excellent site to pilot  landscape-level planning for REDD and in doing so helps develop national capacity to implement REDD methods and approaches and conserve the Protected Areas within these landscapes.<br/><br/>As an initial step, we propose a landscape scale analysis that evaluates the potential of different use zones in Takamanda Mone. Activities will be:<br/><br/>1.\tREDD capacity building and outreach among local and national government departments.<br/>2.\tEvaluating carbon stocks in different land-use types under different types of management (managed vs. unmanaged production forest, protected forest, plantations, agriculture, etc.).<br/>3.\tEvaluating rates of change of land-use (improved remote sensing and extensive ground-truthing) both in the Takamanda-Mone TOU and in a wider Reference Area.<br/>4.\tCompletion of a summary study on the potential options for REDD development in the landscape and a roadmap for moving forward.<br/><br/>The analysis will set the stage for a landscape wide plan to mitigate climate change, protect biodiversity, and support livelihood creation.",

These resources play a vital role in ensuring food security and producing economic benefits for the local population. In order to preserve the biodiversity, the Government of Guinea-Bissau created a system of protected areas, covering 12% of its territory. Unfortunately, the institution responsible for the management of these protected areas, the Institute of Biodiversity and Protected areas, faces difficulties ensuring effective monitoring of these protected areas. This project aims to strengthen the management and create effective monitoring of 3 marine protected areas in Guinea-Bissau.",
		"description": "En raison de sa géographie particulière et du bon état de conservation de ses écosystèmes, notamment les mangroves et l’archipel des Bijagós, la zone côtière de la Guinée-Bissau dispose encore d’une biodiversité remarquable et de ressources naturelles relativement abondantes. Ces ressources jouent un rôle vital pour les populations du pays soit pour leur sécurité alimentaire soit pour leur économie. <br/><br/>Afin de préserver les sources de cette biodiversité le Gouvernement de Guinée-Bissau a créé un système d’aires protégées qui couvrent près de 12% de son territoire. L’Institution responsable de la gestion de ces aires protégées, l’Institut de la Biodiversité et des Aires Protégées (IBAP) éprouve cependant des difficultés à assurer une surveillance efficace en disposant seulement d’une moyenne de 5 gardes pour chacune des aires protégées et des équipements rudimentaires. <br/><br/>Ces difficultés sont rencontrées notamment vis-à-vis des  pêcheurs migrants venus d’autres pays de la région où les ressources sont moins abondantes. La surveillance maritime proprement dite est particulièrement complexe en raison des superficies concernées, de la mobilité des pêcheurs et des risques encourus par les gardes face à des embarcations illégales disposant souvent d’armes à feu. Il n’est pas rare que des campements illégaux s’installent dans des zones de mangrove où ils sont difficiles à repérer puis à déguerpir .Il est donc impératif d’élaborer et mettre en œuvre une véritable stratégie de surveillance maritime reposant sur un personnel formé, des équipements performants, des normes de fonctionnement éprouvées ainsi qu’un mécanisme de suivi-évaluation adapté.<br/><br/>Les pratiques de pêche observées sont rarement durables en raison des engins utilisés (filets dérivants, sennes tournantes, filets monofilaments) des emplacements (fermeture de bras de mer, intérieur des mangroves) des espèces ciblées (raies et requins pour leurs ailerons, lamantins) et de l’utilisation massive du bois de mangrove pour le fumage des captures mais aussi pour la commercialisation vers les pays limitrophes. Ces difficultés rencontrées risquent de compromettre à terme les efforts de conservation de la Guinée-Bissau et de provoquer une érosion structurelle de la biodiversité, des ressources naturelles ainsi que la dégradation des conditions de vie et des patrimoines culturels des populations qui résident dans ces 3 aires marines protégées.",

Grâce à ses importantes superficies de mangroves, ses hauts-fonds et vasières et l’étendue de sa partie maritime, le Parc National d’Orango est également considéré comme une zone de reproduction majeure pour les ressources halieutiques.<br/><br/>Le Parc National Marin des îles de João Vieira-Poilão (PNMJVP), également dans l’archipel des Bijagós, regroupe 4 îles considérées comme sacrées par l’ethnie Bijago. Elles ont ainsi bénéficié d’un statut de protection traditionnel depuis les temps anciens, ce qui explique leur état de conservation remarquable. L’île de Poilão accueille la plus importante colonie de reproduction de tortues vertes des côtes occidentales de l’Afrique avec une moyenne de 7000 pontes par année et un pic de 29 000 pontes. Quatre autres espèces de tortues marines se reproduisent également dans le parc, dans des proportions plus modestes. Plusieurs îlots sableux accueillent des colonies nicheuses de sternes. La partie maritime, qui occupe l’essentiel de la superficie du Parc, est considérée comme particulièrement riche en ressources halieutiques avec une diversité remarquable de raies et requins parmi lesquels le rarissime poisson-scie menacé d’extinction dans la sous-région.<br/><br/>Les deux Parcs nationaux de l’archipel font partie intégrante d’une demande de classement de l’Archipel des Bijagós en Site du Patrimoine Mondial en cours d’instruction auprès des services de l’UNESCO.<br/>Les 3 aires marines protégées sont exploitées et gérées traditionnellement par les différentes ethnies qui les occupent et qui bénéficient de droits d’accès exclusifs. Cette relation ancienne avec leur environnement est à l’origine de savoirs d’une grande richesse, savoirs qui sont mis à profit par l’IBAP et ses partenaires dans la définition des règles de gestion actuelles.  La conservation de la biodiversité et des ressources naturelles de ces zones est essentielle pour la survie des patrimoines culturels des ethnies considérées.",

		"summary": "The aim of this project is to improve the management of the Togodo-South and Togodo-North Complex and strengthen the national system of protected areas in Togo. This is particularly important due to the poor management of protected areas in the country and lack of effective policies related to the creation and management of protected areas, which would improve the living conditions of the local population and contribute to income generation. As a result, the idea of conservation has been met with resistance from the local communities, while the management of the system of protected areas in Togo remains inadequate. For this reason, it is very important to improve the management of the existing protected areas in the Togodo-South and Togodo-North Complex and create new ones in a manner that involves the local communities and allows them to generate benefits from the protected areas.",
		"description": "Les aires protégées du Togo connaissent des occupations humaines et physiques à partir des années 90 suite aux troubles sociopolitiques qu’a connus le pays. Le Complexe Togodo-sud et Togodo-Nord n’est pas épargné du fléau à l’origine de la mauvaise gouvernance des aires protégées, avec l’expropriation non concertée des terres pour la conservation de la faune, la gestion draconienne et non participative des ressources naturelles, le non balisage des limites et  la mise en valeur des aires protégées. <br/><br/>Ceci a eu pour conséquence la faible application des textes législatifs et réglementaires régissant la conservation des ressources biologiques mettant en péril les aires protégées. L’absence d’appui financier aux populations pour le développement  d’activités génératrices de revenus a accentué l’érosion des terres fertiles avec des pratiques  agricoles extensives fragilisant ainsi les conditions de vie des populations riveraines. <br/><br/>Aussi, le manque de capacités humaines ainsi que d’appui technique et financier, la vétusté de matériel de travail et d’équipement ont-ils fragilisé l’efficacité de gestion des aires protégées.<br/><br/>La combinaison des éléments ci-dessus a entrainé la dégradation de la biodiversité, les changements climatiques, le renforcement de la pauvreté et la misère généralisée des populations.<br/><br/>Ainsi donc la mise en œuvre de ce projet permettra d’améliorer les conditions de vie des populations riveraines, d’atténuer les menaces qui pèsent sur les aires protégées y compris le Complexe Togodo-Sud et Togodo-Nord et leurs ressources à travers une gestion durable de celles-ci, de contribuer non seulement à la  conservation durable de la biodiversité mais également de renforcer le système des aires protégées tant au niveau  national que global.",

Les écosystèmes terrestres comprennent les forêts semi décidues, les forêts claires, la savane arborée et la savane arbustive, les fourrées,  les prairies et la broussaille. Les zones humides sont bordées de forêts galeries.  <br/><br/>Aussi, la zone est-elle constituée des zones humides naturelles représentées par le Mono, des mares et étangs permanents et/ou temporaires d’importance écologique.

En ce qui concerne les oiseaux,  il faut noter que le Heron goliath (Ardea goliath) est aujourd’hui menacé de disparition. Parmi celles-ci près de 20 espèces animales sont déclarées rares, menacées et/ou en voie de disparition. <br/>Le Complexe Togodo-Sud et Togodo-Nord est limité à l’Est avec le Bénin par le Fleuve Mono où une initiative de constitution d’aire protégée communautaire est en cours.

Le projet est en conformité avec les priorités définies dans le Document  Stratégique de Réduction de la Pauvreté (DSRP) du Togo, le Programme Conjoint de Réduction de la Pauvreté et de Localisation des OMD, ainsi que le Plan National d’Action pour l’Environnement (PNAE) adopté en juillet 2006. La traduction opérationnelle du PNAE est le Programme National de Gestion de l’Environnement (PNGE), qui inclut le Programme National d’Actions Décentralisées de Gestion de l’Environnement (PNADE) du Xème FED, dont le démarrage est prévu en 2010.<br/> <br/>En outre, l’adoption et la promulgation de la Loi cadre sur l’Environnement (Loi n°2008-005 du 30 Mai 2008) et du code Forestier (Loi n°2008-009) montrent  la volonté du gouvernement de prendre en compte les aspects environnementaux de façon transversale en intégrant la société civile à tous les niveaux du développement (national, régional, local). Ainsi, cette Loi-cadre établit la participation des populations, des ONG et des collectivités locales à l’élaboration et à la mise en œuvre des actions de gestion de l’Environnement (art. 24-26). Elle formalise le partenariat entre l’État et les autres acteurs non gouvernementaux en vue d’assurer une gestion durable de l’Environnement (art.27-29). Elle traite également de l’accès des populations à l’information et à l’éducation environnementale (art. 30). Enfin, ce projet reprend les résultats d’une étude conduite en 2001 dans le cadre du COM-STABEX/91-94 financé par l’Union Européenne concernant la stratégie globale de réhabilitation des AP au Togo. <br/>Ce projet est en conformité avec les Stratégies Nationales de mise en œuvre des conventions internationales environnementales (en particulier la Convention sur la Diversité Biologique), élaborées ces dernières années au Togo avec l’appui du PNUD/FEM. Il est également en conformité avec l’Objectif Stratégique 1 du FEM concernant la biodiversité",

It includes the development of six business plans and at least the same number of public-private partnerships in southeast Europe and is based on thorough Protected Area need assessments.

		"description": "Even though South-East Europe is a region of great natural beauty, most of rural communities living in or around high natural value areas have yet to benefit from the ongoing changes. In order for protected areas to remain a viable concept and continue safeguarding great natural values of the region, it is imperative that they also become engines in supporting local development.<br/>In collaboration with national governments, in 2008/09, WWF conducted assessments of management effectiveness (RAPPAM) of systems of protected areas in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia. Analysis shows clearly that increased efforts are needed to transform and modernize the system of protected areas, particularly in the area of sustainable financing – including development of new business models, diversification of funding sources and greater engagement of private sector.<br/>The key constraints for enlisting the private sector in this endeavour can be summarized in the following two main points:<br/>1. Lack of understanding between the worlds of business and biodiversity conservation. - Modern, transparent business plans for protected areas do not exist, natural resource managers in the public administration lack the financial acumen and consumer orientation of the private sector, while most business lack understanding of how to best take opportunity of the sustainable use of natural resources. <br/>2. Absence of enabling environment for biodiversity business. - Existing policies are predicated on conservation of biodiversity by governments,  and the framework of laws, regulations, taxes, subsidies and social norms are constraining the opportunities for businesses to engage in biodiversity conservation.",

This major political achievement was spearheaded by WWF Mediterranean Programme, in collaboration with Dinaric Arc Initiative partners .<br/><br/>Through national commitments, parties committed to establishing at least 13 new protected areas, and the enlargement of nine existing protected areas. In their joint statement (see below), parties recognized that a joint and coordinated effort is needed for safeguarding the Dinaric Arc ecoregion’s exceptional natural and cultural values. WWF and other organizations in the region that supported this event (DAI partners) committed to supporting the government’s efforts to deliver on their commitments. This project is supporting the delivery of commitments 7 (Encourage the preservation of the cultural heritage of the Dinaric Arc through support for traditional activities in protected areas which contribute to biodiversity conservation and local livelihoods) and 9 (Support evaluation of the contribution of protected areas to each country’s economy and for the region as a whole) from the joint statement, as well as some national-level commitments.

The project sets out the ambitious ten-year fundraising target of 100 million USD.",
		"description": "National Context<br/><br/>1.\tCovering an area of about 784,000 km2, Mozambique is located on the southeastern coast of Africa. It is bounded by Tanzania to the north; by the Mozambique Channel (Indian Ocean) in the east; on the south and southwest by South Africa and Swaziland; and on the west by Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi (Figure 1). The country is generally low-lying, with only 13 percent of the country above 1,000 m. The land ascends in a westward direction from the coast through a coastal lowland that is narrow in the north but broad in the south (~44% of the total land area), through a sub-plateau zone to an extensive low-lying plateau of moderate height, and finally up to a narrow higher-lying area on the western border. The climate ranges from subtropical in the south to tropical in the center and north. Most of the country receives above 400 mm of rainfall per annum, with the rainy season extending from October to April. The coastal zone receives up to 900 mm of rain per year. The north region is more humid than the south, except in the Upper Zambezi region in Tete, where it is dry and hot. <br/><br/>Socio-economic context:<br/><br/>2.\tAt the end of the armed conflict in 1992, Mozambique ranked among the poorest countries in the world. It still ranks among the least developed nations, with very low well-being indicators (Table 3). More than 70 percent of Mozambicans live in extreme poverty (<US$2/d). In 2007, 38 percent of the population was undernourished and only 42 percent had access to an improved water source. The country ranks 172 out of 177 in the UNDP’s Human Development Index (HDI), the lowest in southern African. <br/><br/>3.\tThe population of ~21 million is growing at a rate of about 2.4 percent. Population density is low (~25/km2). The north-central provinces of Zambezia and Nampula are the most populous, with about 45% of the population. In the central zone, people are concentrated along the Beira Corridor, and in the south, around Maputo. More than 70 percent of the population live along the coastal area, and about 68 percent live in rural areas. Population dynamics and economic growth are both likely to be affected by HIV/AIDS, for which the adult prevalence rate is estimated at 12.2%. Catholics comprise 24 percent of the population, while Muslims comprise 18 percent. Mozambique's major ethnic groups encompass numerous sub-groups with diverse languages, dialects, cultures, and histories. <br/><br/>4.\tIn 1987, the government embarked on a series of macro-economic reforms to stabilize the economy. These steps, combined with donor assistance and with political stability since multi-party elections in 1994, have led to improvements in the country's growth rate. Mozambique's once substantial foreign debt has been reduced through forgiveness and rescheduling under Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIDP) and Multilateral Debt Relief initiatives. As a result of the debt relief it has received, the Government of Mozambique’s outstanding debt stock has fallen from 25% of GDP in 2005 to under 12 % of GDP today, well below debt distress thresholds determined by the IMF. Fiscal reforms, including introduction of a value-added tax and reform of the Customs Service, have also improved the government's revenue collection abilities. In spite of these gains, Mozambique still remains dependent upon foreign assistance for much of its budget, and most of the population lives below the poverty line. Subsistence agriculture continues to employ the vast majority of the country's work force. <br/><br/>5.\tMozambique’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was US$20.17 billion in 2009 (up from US$17.64 billion in 2008) and foreign direct investments (FDI) was US$1.8 billion. The 2010 forecast economic growth rate is estimated at 6.3%, some 2% higher than 2009. Agriculture accounted for 21% of the GDP in 2008. Agricultural exports included: cotton; cashew nuts; sugarcane; tea; cassava; corn; coconuts; sisal; citrus and tropical fruits; potatoes; sunflowers; beef and poultry. Domestically consumed food crops included corn; pigeon peas; cassava; rice; beef; pork; chicken; and goat. Although more than 80% of the 20,3 million people (2009 estimate) in Mozambique engages in small-scale agriculture, the sector still suffers from severely inadequate infrastructure, commercial networks, and investment . Industry accounted for 31% of GDP in 2008, and included production of: food; beverages; chemicals (fertilizer, soap, paints); aluminum; petroleum products; textiles; cement; glass; asbestos; and tobacco. 2009 was a record year for industrial and agricultural development in Mozambique, with nearly US$6 billion approved across some 250 projects . Services  accounted for some 39.7% of GDP in 2008. Of these, tourism accounted for 5% of GDP. With little central planning, tourism income has grown to US$481m (~1.5 million visitors) in 2009, mainly through independent tourism initiatives. There are significant unexploited mineral resources in Mozambique, and prospecting is occurring for oil, gas, diamonds and uranium, with export revenue expected to reach US$500 million in 2010/11. <br/><br/>6.\tThe country’s economy will, in the medium- to long-term, continue to rely largely on its natural resource base. Even with rapid rates of urbanization, the subsistence and well-being of most Mozambicans depends largely on their access to land, water resources, forest products, fisheries, mines, and other natural resources. The government is trying to balance its immediate goal of reducing poverty through use of natural resources, with longer-term strategies requiring judicious management of these resources. Limited domestic funds are however leading to a heavy reliance on foreign capital to support these strategies.",

		"ecological_contribution": "1.\tThe main vegetation type in Mozambique is savanna woodland. It covers 70 percent of Mozambique’s land area and can broadly be divided into two types: miombo and mopane woodlands. Miombo is the most extensive and covers much of Niassa, Cabo Delgado, Nampula, Zambezia, Sofala, Manica, and Inhambane Provinces. Other important vegetation types include: Acacia woodland, found in the southern and central parts of the country); dune forest, which occurs on high dunes along the coast between the southern border and Bazaruto Island; a sub-littoral woodland, found inland from the dune forest in the sub-littoral zone between Ponto do Ouro and Macia; lowland palm savanna, in coastal areas in Nampula, Sofala, and Inhambane Province); vegetation on alluviums in the Zambezi Delta and the lower Limpopo and Inkomati Valleys; and mangroves, which are well-developed in the northern and central sectors of the coast and less so along the southern sector. More than 5500 species of plants (including 250 known endemic species and 46 threatened species), 222 mammal species (including several endemic sub-species), 740 species of birds (with many near endemic and restricted-range species); 167 species of reptiles  (three of which are endemic and six of which are threatened); 79 reptile species (including 28 endemic species); and 3,074 species of insects (at least 1 of which is endemic) have been identified to date.  The freshwater and marine wetlands of Mozambique are important sites for migratory and resident aquatic bird species. One of the most important wetland sites in Mozambique is the Zambezi delta, where more than 50 species of aquatic birds have been recorded. The delta supports numerous vulnerable and threatened bird species of global concern. Several large mammal species are thought to be extinct or on the verge of extinction in Mozambique. These include the black and white rhino, giraffe, roan antelope, tsessebe, the mountain reedbuck, and the African wild dog. Seven other species, including the African hunting dog, Selinda veld rat, woodland mouse, and chequered elephant shrew, are threatened. <br/><br/>2.\tThe Mozanbican coast can be divided into three main natural regions: the coral coast ( the northernmost coast extending for 770 km); the swampy coast (about 978 km of length, between Angoche and Bazaruto Island; and the parabolic dune coast ( the southernmost coast, with 880 km of length between Bazaruto and Ponto do Ouro) - with one additional type of limited occurrence, namely the delta coast at mouth of the Save and Zambezi Rivers.The coastline is characterized by diverse habitats, including: estuarine systems; coastal wetlands; coastal dunes; sandy beaches; intertidal mud flats; mangrove forests ; seagrass beds; coral reefs and open water that are home to a rich and diverse assemblage of plant and animal species.  This includes: 150 species of coral; more than 1734 fish species; at least 243 species of seaweed; 63 species of marine birds; the largest remaining populations of dugong in East Africa; and significant populations of marine turtles and other cetaceans. <br/><br/>3.\tFourteen ecological regions are represented in Mozambique, of which seven are of global importance: Agulhas Current; East African Coast; Lakes of the Rift Valley; East African Mangroves; Forests of the South Rift Valley; East and Central Miombo; and Savannas of the Zambezi Floodplains. The country contains three areas designated by Conservation International as ‘Biodiversity Hotspots’ - Eastern Afromontane in various highland areas located in the centre and west of the country; Coastal Forests of Eastern Africa, stretching along the coastal belt; and the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany Hotspot, located in the southern part of the country. Mozambique also possesses specific sites of high biodiversity importance, such as the Gorongosa Mountain, the Archipelago of Quirimbas, and the Chimanimani Massif. A number of terrestrial areas of outstanding ecosystem, biological and/or scenic value have been identified in Mozambique, and are considered to warrant special attention (Table 1).<br/><br/>SEE TABLE 1: AREAS OF OUTSTANDING ECOSYSTEM, BIOLOGICAL AND/OR SCENIC VALUE IN MOZAMBIQUE <br/><br/><br/>4.\tAlong the Mozambican coastal area, nine biodiversity conservation priority areas covering 66,800 km² have been identified for their contribution to flora and fauna species diversity, as breeding grounds for migratory avifauna and several aquatic species, including humpback whales, dugongs, and sea turtles, and for their extensive coral reefs. These centers of biodiversity are the Mtwara-Quirimba, the Nacala-Mossiril, Ilhas Primeiras e Segundas, Zambezi River Delta System, Sofala Bay, Bazaruto Archipelago, Inhambane Bay, Inharrime Complex, and Maputo Bay-Machangulo Complex. <br/><br/><br/>Threats and root-causes<br/><br/>5.\tThe  key threats to biodiversity in Mozambique include: (i) habitat fragmentation and removal of natural vegetation; (ii) food insecurity and subsistence agricultural practices; (iv) soil depletion and erosion; (v) mining and industrial development; and (vi) overexploitation of coastal and marine resources. <br/><br/>6.\tHabitat Fragmentation and Removal of Natural Vegetation - Habitat fragmentation and removal of natural vegetation are resulting from: conversion of native habitats to cropland; over-exploitation of forests; illegal wood procurement for export; slash-and-burn practices; water pollution and sedimentation; uncontrolled removal of vegetation; use of firewood as a source of energy; charcoal production; and uncontrolled bush fires. It is estimated that Mozambique has an annual deforestation rate of 0.58% and loses some 219,000 ha of forest per annum as a result of conversion to mostly subsistence agriculture . The rate of deforestation varies among the provinces, but Nampula Province in the northern region has the highest rate of loss per year.<br/><br/>7.\tFood Insecurity and Subsistence Agricultural Practices -  High levels of food insecurity are prevalent in certain parts of the country. Food insecurity is leading people to hunt illegally and use unsustainable agricultural practices, which in turn contribute to the decline of many species and their habitats. In spite of an abundance of arable land in Mozambique (the FAO estimates 36 million ha) only 4.9 million is cultivated, 75 percent of which is estimated to be used for unsustainable ‘slash-and-burn’ subsistence agriculture. These production systems are highly consumptive, soil depleting, and contribute to increased erosion. While extensive livestock grazing is also common among subsistence farmers, it is also considered relatively unproductive.<br/><br/>8.\tSoil Depletion and Erosion - Considerable erosion is occuring due to extreme weather events like droughts or heavy rains on severely degraded soils. Poor land-use practices - which include deforestation of coastal and inland areas - are the main contributors to sedimentation of the coastal and marine environments of Mozambique. As a downstream riparian country with a significant number of major rivers with high variability of water flows and limited infrastructure for water management, Mozambique is vulnerable to events outside its control. This is well illustrated by the floods in 2000, because in most international rivers, flows are generated outside the national territory. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the difficulty of building water infrastructure, and the low efficiency and poor state of maintenance of existing infrastructure.<br/><br/>9.\tMining and industrial development - The Law on Mining (14/2002) currently states that mining operations shall have priority over other land uses (including ‘protected zones’) when economic and social benefits related to these operations are higher. Prospecting for uranium, oil, diamonds and gas is beginning to occur in prime tourist areas and areas of high conservation value (e.g. Quirimbas Archipelago, Pemba) in Mozambique. Extensive erosion and silting of rivers by small-scale mining in a number of conservation-worthy areas is already occuring (e.g. gold panning in the Chimanimani TFCA). Along the Mozambican coastline, industrial activities are mainly concentrated in the Maputo/Matola and Beira areas. Few industries are currently treating their effluents, which are discharged directly into canals, rivers, and coastal waters. Many of these contain toxic chemical and heavy metals. Analysis of water quality samples from rivers entering Maputo Bay have tested positive for heavy metals - particularly lead - in a number of localities. These include the Port of Maputo, the mouths of Matola and Maputo Rivers, and Nacala Bay. <br/><br/>10.\tOver-exploitation of Coastal and Marine Resources - The principal threats to the future sustainability of fisheries in Mozambique are reported to include: unlicensed fishing, in particular by foreign tuna and shark and high sea vessels; encroachment on fishing grounds/zones reserved for semi-industrial and artisanal fisheries by industrial fishing vessels; encroachment into shallow water shrimp fishing grounds/zones by unlicensed or unauthorized vessels; deficiencies in recording and reporting of catches in the official logbooks; difficulties in controlling artisanal fisheries distributed along the entire coastal line and in fresh water lakes and rivers; unsustainable exploitation of mangrove forests for charcoal and firewood;  and difficulties in controlling recreational and sport fisheries and protecting endangered species, like shark and dugong. Other major threats to coastal ecosystems include; expansion of aquaculture infra-structure in mangrove forests and mud flats; oil, gas, and mineral prospecting; damming of major water courses; pollution from agriculture practices upstream; and poorly planned coastal tourism facilities.<br/><br/>11.\tThe estimated costs of environmental degradation, amounting to nearly US$370 million in 2009 (MICOA, 2009), represents more than 6% of Mozambican GDP (see figure 2) and 20% of Overseas Development Assistance (ODA). Of this, some US$50m per annum comprises depletion of the natural resource base (figure 3).<br/><br/>SEE FIGURE 3: Costs (US$) of environmental degradation in Mozambique (2009)",

The government contributes general budget support for operational expenses in conservation areas through the provincial directorates of MITUR and the Provincial Governments. Salaries of staff working in conservation areas are paid by provincial government offices. <br/><br/>3.\tThe main income sources from the use of protected areas and their natural resources include: user fees (such as entry fees, accomodation, fishing fees, guided tours and diving fees); fees from licenses for use of natural resources (timber concessions, live game sales and hunting concessions); income from fines and auction sales of confiscated goods (predominantly timber);  and income from nature-based tourism concessions. Except in the case of Limpopo NP (where a special agreement enables the park to keep the revenues generated within its borders to be used to offset operating and investment costs), the income from protected areas is submitted to the relevant provincial Financial Administration Office where a portion is allocated to the state budget (20%), a portion to the  affected local community (16%) and the remainder (64%) returned (on application) to the relevant protected area for disbursement . Table 2 summarises the income generated from the protected areas for the period 2005-2009.<br/><br/>4.\tOther government ministries may also provide direct financing or in-kind support for conservation areas.  For example, under a Memorandum of Understanding signed in December 2004 between MITUR and the Ministry of National Defence (MDN) the MDN has provided weapons and ammunition to three different National Parks. In addition to material support, the MDN has placed military personnel inside six National Parks and Reserves, paying their salaries and other benefits, and contributing to their food needs as well.<br/><br/>SEE TABLE 2: INCOME (in US$) GENERATED DIRECTCTLY FROM THE PROTECTED AREAS IN MOZAMBIQUE FOR 2005-2009<br/><br/><br/>5.\tBilateral and multilateral donor projects, supported by donors such as France (AFD, FFEM), Germany (KFW), US (USAID), the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the World Bank, provide the largest share of funding for Mozambique’s conservation areas. Protected areas are still heavily dependent on donor funding to sustain even the most basic operational functions. Donors currently provide about US$16-22 million annually in financing for Mozambique’s conservation areas (see also Table 3) . The Biodiversity and Environmental Working Groups provide forums for government and donor coordination, with participation from other stakeholders.  <br/><br/>6.\tBased on the content of this submission to CBD’s LifeWeb platfor, the government of Mozambique and its partners in this project intend to hold a round table among international coooperation partners. The goal of this round table will be to communicatethe vision and specific goals of this project to various intenrational cooperation partners at the same time, strengthen interest of both traditional and non-traditional donors, and facilitate coordination among the donor partners visavis these project priorities. This round table process will be co-convened with support of the CBD’s LifeWeb, and it is anticipated the first meeting will be held in late 2010 or early 2011.<br/><br/>SEE TABLE 3: SUMMARY OF THE PRIMARY FUNDING SUPPORT FROM DONOR PARTNERS FOR PROTECTED AREAS IN MOZAMBIQUE (as at April, 2010)<br/><br/><br/>7.\tBased on a preliminary calculation undertaken during 2010 for the National Parks, National Reserves  and Forest Reserves) , the costs (funding necessary to cover core staff costs, basic conservation activities and basic investments) for protected areas are conservatively estimated at US$19,837,459 per year. With current revenues of US$14,897,402 (including donor funds) or US$1,239,855(excluding donor funds), this equates to a funding gap of US$ 4,940,058 (with donor funds) or US$ 18,597,605 (without donor funds) per annum. <br/><br/>8.\tThe estimated annual costs for all categories of conservation areas has also been estimated during the PPG phase and is summarised in Table 4 below.<br/><br/>SEE TABLE 4:  ESTIMATED ANNUAL COSTS (2010 US DOLLARS) FOR MOZAMBIQUE’S CONSERVATION AREAS",

		"alignment": "1.\tThe legislative and regulatory framework for protected areas in Mozambique is relatively well developed. It adequately provides for inter alia: the total or partial protection of significant areas under some form of conservation land use; the institutional roles and responsibilities for different PA categories; the rights of communities living and around these conservation and protected areas; the development of a range of partnerships between the state and the private sector, communities, NGOs and other institutions; a range of different financing mechanisms for protected areas; and the distribution of financial benefits from the use of protected areas to affected local communities. <br/>2.\tThe Principles for the Administration of Protected Areas in Mozambique (Resolution of the Council of Ministers, 2006) details the options for the management and development of protected areas. It specifically provides for co-management partnerships between the state and the private sector, local communities, NGOs and other institutions.    <br/>3.\tThe government has adopted, or is in the process of developing, a number of policies, strategies and plans to meet its biodiversity conservation obligations in terms of the CBD. The National Environmental Management Programme (NEMP) is the master plan for environment management in Mozambique. It contains a national environment policy, environment umbrella legislation (see above), and an environmental strategy. The NEMP is also a program of sectoral plans, containing projections for the medium- and long-term aiming to lead the country to sustainable socio-economic development. Within the framework of the NEMP, a number of biodiversity conservation strategies and plans have also been prepared. These include inter alia: the National Biodiversity and Action Plan (2003) covering the period 2003-2010; the Integrated Coastal Zone Management Program; and the Human Wildlife Mitigation Strategy (2009). <br/>4.\tOf particular relevance for protected areas is the new Conservation Policy and Implementation Strategy (2009) covering the period 2009-2019.  The Conservation  Policy aims to: (i) harmonize laws and sectoral policies among the ministries (MITUR, MINAG, MICOA, and the Ministry of Public Works and Housing); and (ii) establish systems for inter-institutional coordination, mechanisms for the involvement of civil society, strategies for management of parks and reserves, and criteria for new areas of conservation and reclassification of areas of conservation. It also makes recommendations for decentralizing management of conservation areas, and identifies mechanisms for the integration of communities as beneficiaries of conservation areas. In addition, it makes recommendations for clarification of areas of responsibility and coordination between MITUR and the Ministry of Fisheries in marine conservation areas.",

					"description": "National Context<br/><br/>1.\tCovering an area of about 784,000 km2, Mozambique is located on the southeastern coast of Africa. It is bounded by Tanzania to the north; by the Mozambique Channel (Indian Ocean) in the east; on the south and southwest by South Africa and Swaziland; and on the west by Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi (Figure 1). The country is generally low-lying, with only 13 percent of the country above 1,000 m. The land ascends in a westward direction from the coast through a coastal lowland that is narrow in the north but broad in the south (~44% of the total land area), through a sub-plateau zone to an extensive low-lying plateau of moderate height, and finally up to a narrow higher-lying area on the western border. The climate ranges from subtropical in the south to tropical in the center and north. Most of the country receives above 400 mm of rainfall per annum, with the rainy season extending from October to April. The coastal zone receives up to 900 mm of rain per year. The north region is more humid than the south, except in the Upper Zambezi region in Tete, where it is dry and hot. <br/><br/>Socio-economic context:<br/><br/>2.\tAt the end of the armed conflict in 1992, Mozambique ranked among the poorest countries in the world. It still ranks among the least developed nations, with very low well-being indicators (Table 3). More than 70 percent of Mozambicans live in extreme poverty (<US$2/d). In 2007, 38 percent of the population was undernourished and only 42 percent had access to an improved water source. The country ranks 172 out of 177 in the UNDP’s Human Development Index (HDI), the lowest in southern African. <br/><br/>3.\tThe population of ~21 million is growing at a rate of about 2.4 percent. Population density is low (~25/km2). The north-central provinces of Zambezia and Nampula are the most populous, with about 45% of the population. In the central zone, people are concentrated along the Beira Corridor, and in the south, around Maputo. More than 70 percent of the population live along the coastal area, and about 68 percent live in rural areas. Population dynamics and economic growth are both likely to be affected by HIV/AIDS, for which the adult prevalence rate is estimated at 12.2%. Catholics comprise 24 percent of the population, while Muslims comprise 18 percent. Mozambique's major ethnic groups encompass numerous sub-groups with diverse languages, dialects, cultures, and histories. <br/><br/>4.\tIn 1987, the government embarked on a series of macro-economic reforms to stabilize the economy. These steps, combined with donor assistance and with political stability since multi-party elections in 1994, have led to improvements in the country's growth rate. Mozambique's once substantial foreign debt has been reduced through forgiveness and rescheduling under Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIDP) and Multilateral Debt Relief initiatives. As a result of the debt relief it has received, the Government of Mozambique’s outstanding debt stock has fallen from 25% of GDP in 2005 to under 12 % of GDP today, well below debt distress thresholds determined by the IMF. Fiscal reforms, including introduction of a value-added tax and reform of the Customs Service, have also improved the government's revenue collection abilities. In spite of these gains, Mozambique still remains dependent upon foreign assistance for much of its budget, and most of the population lives below the poverty line. Subsistence agriculture continues to employ the vast majority of the country's work force. <br/><br/>5.\tMozambique’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was US$20.17 billion in 2009 (up from US$17.64 billion in 2008) and foreign direct investments (FDI) was US$1.8 billion. The 2010 forecast economic growth rate is estimated at 6.3%, some 2% higher than 2009. Agriculture accounted for 21% of the GDP in 2008. Agricultural exports included: cotton; cashew nuts; sugarcane; tea; cassava; corn; coconuts; sisal; citrus and tropical fruits; potatoes; sunflowers; beef and poultry. Domestically consumed food crops included corn; pigeon peas; cassava; rice; beef; pork; chicken; and goat. Although more than 80% of the 20,3 million people (2009 estimate) in Mozambique engages in small-scale agriculture, the sector still suffers from severely inadequate infrastructure, commercial networks, and investment . Industry accounted for 31% of GDP in 2008, and included production of: food; beverages; chemicals (fertilizer, soap, paints); aluminum; petroleum products; textiles; cement; glass; asbestos; and tobacco. 2009 was a record year for industrial and agricultural development in Mozambique, with nearly US$6 billion approved across some 250 projects . Services  accounted for some 39.7% of GDP in 2008. Of these, tourism accounted for 5% of GDP. With little central planning, tourism income has grown to US$481m (~1.5 million visitors) in 2009, mainly through independent tourism initiatives. There are significant unexploited mineral resources in Mozambique, and prospecting is occurring for oil, gas, diamonds and uranium, with export revenue expected to reach US$500 million in 2010/11. <br/><br/>6.\tThe country’s economy will, in the medium- to long-term, continue to rely largely on its natural resource base. Even with rapid rates of urbanization, the subsistence and well-being of most Mozambicans depends largely on their access to land, water resources, forest products, fisheries, mines, and other natural resources. The government is trying to balance its immediate goal of reducing poverty through use of natural resources, with longer-term strategies requiring judicious management of these resources. Limited domestic funds are however leading to a heavy reliance on foreign capital to support these strategies.",

A nivel mundial, México es considerado el segundo país con mayores índices de deforestación, que varían de acuerdo al tipo de vegetación, periodo y escala del estudio. La desaparición de especies y poblaciones tiene profundos impactos en la estructura y función de los ecosistemas, así como en la provisión de los servicios ambientales. <br/><br/>Ante estos escenarios es apremiante diseñar estrategias más integrales para la conservación que favorezcan la calidad de vida de los habitantes de  las Áreas Naturales Protegidas y que garanticen el mantenimiento del patrimonio biológico del país En México, las Áreas Naturales Protegidas tienen un papel fundamental en los esfuerzos de conservación de la biodiversidad; no obstante, es necesario aumentar su cobertura y mejorar las capacidades de gestión y operación de la Comisión Nacional de Áreas Naturales Protegidas (CONANP).  En este sentido, la CONANP enfrenta diversos retos entre los que destacan la insuficiencia de recursos humanos, de infraestructura básica y de recursos financieros suficientes para instrumentar las estrategias de manejo y conservación. <br/><br/>Asimismo, se ha detectado que existe un desbalance entre el personal y las capacidades de infraestructura básica para la operación en el campo.

		"ecological_contribution": "México se encuentra entre los cinco países llamados “megadiversos”, los cuales en conjunto albergan entre el 60% y 70% de la diversidad biológica conocida del planeta. En México se encuentra representado el 12% de la diversidad terrestre del planeta. Prácticamente todos los tipos de vegetación terrestres conocidos se encuentran representados en el país, y algunos ecosistemas, como los humedales de Cuatrocienégas en Coahuila se encuentran únicamente en el país. Además, México ocupa el primer lugar en el mundo en riqueza de reptiles, el segundo en mamíferos y el cuarto en anfibios y plantas. La diversidad biológica de nuestro país se caracteriza por estar compuesta de un gran número de especies endémicas, es decir, que son exclusivas al país. Aproximadamente el 50% de las especies de plantas que se encuentran en nuestro territorio son endémicas, esto se traduce en aproximadamente 15,000 especies que, si desaparecieran en México, desaparecerían del planeta. Los reptiles y anfibios tienen una proporción de especies endémicas de 57% y 65%, respectivamente y los mamíferos (terrestres y marinos) de 32%. Sin duda, México enfrenta un enorme reto en la conservación de su diversidad biológica, lo que a la vez ofrece la oportunidad de innovar diversas acciones y estrategias de uso sustentable y conservación de sus recursos naturales. Esta diversidad es el resultado de la compleja topografía y geología, y de los diversos climas y microclimas que se encuentran en todo el territorio. Asimismo, la ubicación geográfica de México hace que se distinga por ser el territorio de unión de dos regiones biogeográficas, la Neártica y la Neotropical, lo que significa que en el país han evolucionado especies de distinta afinidad ecológica y geográfica. En este contexto, las Áreas Naturales Protegidas (ANP) constituyen la  principal estrategia para promover la conservación de los ecosistemas y su biodiversidad. Éstas han sido reconocidas como el instrumento de mayor importancia para la conservación de la biodiversidad. Además, las ANP de carácter federal destacan por su cobertura, ya que actualmente existen 174 áreas que cubren una superficie de un poco más de 25, 384, 818 millones de hectáreas. Existen 6 categorías de Áreas Naturales Protegidas Federales: Reservas de la Biosfera, Parques Nacionales, Áreas de Protección de Flora y Fauna, Áreas de Protección de los Recursos Naturales, Santuarios y Monumentos Naturales.<br/><br/>A pesar de que las áreas protegidas de México han venido atendiendo la protección de la biodiversidad del país, existen áreas de oportunidad para fortalecer el trabajo de conservación de la CONANP. En este sentido, durante la Séptima Conferencia de las Partes de la Convención sobre Diversidad Biológica (CDB) México se comprometió a formular metas orientadas hacia la obtención de resultados respecto a la extensión, representatividad y efectividad del Sistema Nacional de Áreas Naturales Protegidas. En este contexto, en el 2007 se llevó a cabo un  análisis de vacíos y omisiones de conservación terrestre y marina que permite identificar las prioridades ecológicas, en áreas que aún no han sido protegidas, para la aplicación de los recursos, como son el determinar los criterios robustos y técnicos que sirvan de guía para incrementar la superficie con Decretos de protección, así como para considerar otros instrumentos complementarios que ayuden en la conservación de la biodiversidad de México. Asimismo, este objetivo es concurrente con los esfuerzos que la Iniciativa LifeWeb ha venido realizado para la identificación de alternativas de financiamiento que permitan desarrollar los sistemas nacionales y regionales de áreas protegidas que sean participativos, representativos y que contribuyan al bienestar ambiental y social.",

					"summary": "La Comisión Nacional de Áreas Naturales Protegidas (CONANP), encargada de la administración de las Áreas Protegidas de México, busca fortalecer y consolidar la conservación, aprovechamiento sustentable y restauración de las áreas protegidas mexicanas, reconociendo el papel estratégico que juegan para el desarrollo del país. Asimismo, explora alternativas para el manejo de los recursos naturales que permiten transitar hacia un desarrollo sustentable, a través de la implementación de una estrategia financiera diversificada y sostenible a largo plazo.  <br/><br/>El proyecto tiene como objetivo general implementar una estrategia financiera diversificada y sostenible, que contribuya a la conservación, aprovechamiento sustentable y restauración de los sistemas de áreas naturales protegidas mexicanas y que garantice la operatividad de las Áreas Protegidas en el largo plazo.",
					"description": "El aumento de las presiones antropogénicas sobre la biodiversidad, en particular las que causan las elevadas tasas de cambio de uso de suelo, la modificación de los ecosistemas, la extracción ilícita y mal planeada de los recursos naturales, están conduciendo a una pérdida irreversible de especies o sus poblaciones y el deterioro de los ecosistemas. A nivel mundial, México es considerado el segundo país con mayores índices de deforestación, que varían de acuerdo al tipo de vegetación, periodo y escala del estudio. La desaparición de especies y poblaciones tiene profundos impactos en la estructura y función de los ecosistemas, así como en la provisión de los servicios ambientales. <br/><br/>Ante estos escenarios es apremiante diseñar estrategias más integrales para la conservación que favorezcan la calidad de vida de los habitantes de  las Áreas Naturales Protegidas y que garanticen el mantenimiento del patrimonio biológico del país En México, las Áreas Naturales Protegidas tienen un papel fundamental en los esfuerzos de conservación de la biodiversidad; no obstante, es necesario aumentar su cobertura y mejorar las capacidades de gestión y operación de la Comisión Nacional de Áreas Naturales Protegidas (CONANP).  En este sentido, la CONANP enfrenta diversos retos entre los que destacan la insuficiencia de recursos humanos, de infraestructura básica y de recursos financieros suficientes para instrumentar las estrategias de manejo y conservación. <br/><br/>Asimismo, se ha detectado que existe un desbalance entre el personal y las capacidades de infraestructura básica para la operación en el campo. Al respecto cabe mencionar que el promedio mundial de personas asignadas para el manejo de 100,000 hectáreas, es de 27 personas; mientras que en México la proporción es de 6 personas para la misma superficie. Además,  de las 174 Áreas Naturales Protegidas decretadas, 115 cuentan con personal y 48 poseen un Programa de Manejo publicado en el Diario Oficial de la Federación. Por lo tanto, es necesaria una alineación y pertinencia de las escalas de planeación, inventarios de recursos naturales y culturales, zonificación y diseño de planes de manejo de algunas Áreas Naturales Protegidas que no cumplen completamente con los objetivos de conservación.<br/><br/>Adicionalmente, el presupuesto asignado para el manejo y conservación de las Áreas Naturales Protegidas es insuficiente y su valor real ha venido en detrimento desde 2008 debido a las condiciones económicas mundiales. Asimismo, se reconoce que la inversión de fuentes externas en Áreas Naturales Protegidas mexicanas ha disminuido a partir de la crisis mundial. Actualmente se recibe de fuentes externas aproximadamente 87 millones de pesos anuales (8.2 millones de dólares).<br/><br/>Por lo tanto, es estratégico para la CONANP consolidar la cooperación y financiamiento nacional e internacional. En este sentido, es esencial contar con políticas, tales como una Estrategia de Financiamiento, así como información financiera sistematizada sobre ingresos y gastos de recursos, tanto propios (fiscales) como externos que apoyen el fortalecimiento del Sistema de Áreas Protegidas y de lineamientos de políticas internas y externas de cooperación para el financiamiento de las áreas protegidas.",

The surveys and community outreach engage women (and children) very actively.  Campaign design includes women as key parts of the target audience segmentation. <br/><br/>Effective forest management has a major impact on food security, which greatly affects women in their role as providers of food for the family and often as vendors of forest and farm products, as well as supporting food sources for the most marginalized people. This project recognizes important differences in how women and men use, manage, and conserve biological resources. Campaign planning integrates the understanding of gender-based differences and their implications for natural resources management and biodiversity conservation into conservation programs and policies. By giving women a clear role in biodiversity decision-making, the social acceptability and sustainability of forest conservation and management efforts can be enhanced. Involving women is often the most effective avenue for generating behavioral change. <br/>The basic strategy for this program is also partly based on the traditional systems of communal forest management used in some parts of Indonesia today and in practice for many generations.",

		"summary": "Maintaining ecosystem goods and services, integrity, functionality and biome resilience under the effects of human and natural pressures in a climate change context.",
		"description": "<strong>Summary</strong><br/><br/>The main objective of the Ecosystem Based Vision of Biodiversity Conservation for the Amazon Biome initiative is to support the regional implementation of the CBD’s Programme of Work on Protected Areas (PoWPA) in the Amazon region and the achievement of relevant Aichi Targets from the 2011-2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity agreed in Nagoya Japan at the 10th Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity.<br/><br/>In order to achieve these objectives, it is necessary that each of the eight countries and one territory herewith represented by REDPARQUES make further progress on their own PoWPA Action Plans towards consolidating their existing systems of protected areas, their reserves and indigenous territories and their transboundary conservation areas, according to Decision VII/28, and finally that they agree and support the advancement in strengthening technical elements that are broadly applicable and relevant for protected area management the whole Amazon biome.<br/><br/>In terms of conserving biodiversity, addressing climate change, securing livelihoods and contributing toward the achievement of area-based Aichi Targets, this project is highly important because it seeks for well governed and effectively managed protected areas (Target 11) in order to safeguard both habitats and populations of species and for delivering important ecosystem services (Target  6). Furthermore, this project is aligned with Targets 5, 14 and 15, and there is the need for collaboration between neighboring protected areas and the adoption of mechanisms and commitments to strengthen the protected areas systems as natural solutions to climate change, in synergy with the CBD and other conventions according to CBD  Decision XI/24.<br/><br/><strong>Geographical and natural context</strong><br/><br/>The project takes place in the Amazon biome, a region widely recognized for its strategic importance in protecting biodiversity, in global climate regulation and in providing livelihood benefits to millions of people.  The biome covers 6.7 million Km2, spans across eight countries and one overseas territory.<br/><br/>It contains the largest remaining contiguous tropical rainforest on earth with an unparalleled diversity of species and habitats (more than 10% of the world’s known species, including more than 100.000 invertebrates, 40.000 plants and trees, and 3.000 fish), with (macro) species new to science appearing almost every day. Almost 20% of the world’s surface freshwater that reaches the oceans flows through the Amazon basin whose hydrological cycle plays a major role in stabilizing the regional and global climate.<br/><br/>The Amazon biome significantly contributes to maintaining critical ecosystem functions and provides ecological services that are crucial to society. It is home to more than 380 indigenous groups and its rich natural resources base provides a source of livelihoods for more than 44 million people.<br/><br/><strong>Role of Protected Areas</strong><br/><br/>Systems of Protected Areas are recognized as fundamental tools in the articulation and implementation of sustainable development and conservation strategies. They are also an essential part of the global response to climate change and other global change drivers. Protected areas (PAs) store 15% of terrestrial carbon and help address the cause of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By maintaining and supplying essential services upon which people depend – water supply, food and public health – they also contribute towards enhanced community-based adaptation in the face of climate change and play an important role in disaster risk reduction. <br/><br/>In line with the above, through the CBD Programme of Work on Protected Areas (PoWPA) signed through Decision VII/28 at CBD COP 7, Parties have agreed to support the creation and maintenance of comprehensive national and regional systems of protected areas, effectively managed and ecologically representative that contribute to achieving the CBD objectives and to reduce the current rate of biodiversity loss. Additionally, the 2011-2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity, agreed in Nagoya Japan at the 10th Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity, calls for the halt of biodiversity loss and includes 20 explicit targets (Aichi Targets) in which to measure progress. Several (if not all) of these targets require protected areas in order to be achieved. In particular, Aichi Target 11 requires a systematic approach to protected area design, management, monitoring and benefit sharing. <br/><br/>In the Amazon Region, the essential function of PAs is well recognized and the Amazon biome contains today 2.16 % of all PAs worldwide. 78% of PAs that were established in the world between 2003 and 2009 are to be found in the Amazon biome. The National System of Protected Areas in Brazil and the Brazilian Program of Protected Areas for the Amazon Region (ARPA)  in particular are widely recognized as successful examples.<br/><br/><strong>Project Building</strong><br/><br/>Based on the model offered by ARPA and the major opportunities presented by the CBD PoWPA, the Latin-American Network for Technical Cooperation in National Parks, other Protected Areas, Wild Flora and Fauna, otherwise known as REDPARQUES , in partnership with the CBD Secretariat, WWF and IUCN, and with the support and participation of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO) and the Community of Andean of Nations (CAN), led the development of an Ecosystem Based Vision of Conservation of Biological and Cultural Diversity of the Amazon Biome to contribute to the effective administration and management of protected areas systems and the maintenance of goods and services, integrity, functionality and resilience of  the Biome against the effects of natural and anthropogenic pressures and in the context of climate change. <br/><br/>This work began in August 2008 in Bogota (Colombia), where directors and technicians of the systems of protected areas of the Amazon countries came together and put forth some elements of the vision and agreed a program of work to assess progress in implementing elements of PoWPA at a regional level. A series of workshop bringing together various stakeholders was subsequently organised, including inter alia workshops on a) Regional opportunities of conservation in the Amazon biome, b) Integration of the vision of indigenous and local communities in this initiative c) analysis of the effectiveness of protected area management, and d) review of financing strategies for protected areas.<br/><br/>These events contributed towards the articulation of a joint regional conservation vision with four key areas of intervention (priority issues) and one cross cutting issue, and the articulation of its related 2010–2020 Action Plan, mentioned herewith:<br/><br/>1.\tConservation opportunities - Directing actions to plan, select, create, strengthen and manage the national and regional systems and sites of protected areas.<br/>2.\tGovernance, participation, equity and benefit sharing.<br/>3.\tFinancial sustainability.<br/>4.\tManagement effectiveness: standards, assessments and monitoring of protected areas.<br/>5.\tEcosystem services and climate change was identified as a cross cutting theme.<br/><br/>The Action Plan was built under a timeline of ten (10) years (2010-2020), which draws a set of actions on the short (1-4 years), medium (5-7 years) and long (7-10 years) term in order to achieve the PoWPA objectives and goals. Such conservation initiatives have been already recognized at high level meetings such as the CDB COP10 and by the Global Biodiversity Outlook 3, from the CDB Secretariat.<br/><br/><strong>Threats to biodiversity</strong><br/><br/>The Amazon today is increasingly threatened mainly due to the rapidly expanding global markets, the imminent realization of large-scale infrastructure projects coupled with poor planning, weak governance and lack of an integrated vision of sustainable development for the Amazon. These threats are contributing to significant deforestation and increased pressure on the natural resources and environmental services upon which millions of people depend.<br/><br/>Over the past 30 years, the Amazon has lost more than 520.000 Km2 of forest. This has continued since 1990 at an annual rate of up to 27.000 Km2 (an area nearly the size of Belgium). It is estimated that deforestation, including the burning of natural vegetation, is responsible for up to 20% of all global CO2 emissions. The Amazon’s forests store 90-140 billion tons of carbon and releasing even a portion of this would accelerate global warming significantly.<br/><br/>In addition, the combined effects of deforestation and climate change are predicted to result in severe impacts on the Amazon biome/region, such as increased fire incidence, habitat degradation, droughts and river flow changes leading to major shifts in hydrological systems, with potentially catastrophic consequences for local people, their forest resources and the whole region.<br/><br/><strong>Challenges</strong><br/><br/>The future of the region depends on maintaining the integrity of ecosystems, ecological processes, and the regional clime dynamic to be able to resist the threats and pressures from climate change and land use change from the demand for natural resources and economic development. Therefore, the challenge that the involved actors have while building an Ecosystem Based Vision of Conservation of Biological and Cultural Diversity of the Amazon Biome, is to build an efficient long term strategy based on well-articulated national action plans, that focus on the sharing of information and expertise (monitoring, build capacity for, and assist with reporting) to achieve regional implementation of the POWPA and related Aichi Targets.",

The purpose of the workshop was to showcase successful experiences of conservation where there has been co-managing between indigenous peoples or local communities and government institutions, as well as other organizations in the Amazon region. Also, the workshop was the first step to promote governance types of protected areas as well as conservation actions by local and indigenous communities, and empower communities to participate in the regulation and governance of protected areas, promote community participation in the evaluation of ecosystem goods and services and prompt complementary conservation actions.<br/><br/>In consequence, the project will provide capacity reinforcement for conservation at the local level by engaging participation of both formal organizations and traditional institutions, in a bid to increase knowledge around conservation tools and to up scale local experience to be integrated into the landscape and territory management perspective, while promoting larger recognition of the whole UICN matrix based on the benefits of shared-governance and locally-managed conservation areas, as input for major institutional and legal recommendations for national protected areas systems.",

					"description": "<strong>Summary</strong><br/><br/>The main objective of the Ecosystem Based Vision of Biodiversity Conservation for the Amazon Biome initiative is to support the regional implementation of the CBD’s Programme of Work on Protected Areas (PoWPA) in the Amazon region and the achievement of relevant Aichi Targets from the 2011-2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity agreed in Nagoya Japan at the 10th Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity.<br/><br/>In order to achieve these objectives, it is necessary that each of the eight countries and one territory herewith represented by REDPARQUES make further progress on their own PoWPA Action Plans towards consolidating their existing systems of protected areas, their reserves and indigenous territories and their transboundary conservation areas, according to Decision VII/28, and finally that they agree and support the advancement in strengthening technical elements that are broadly applicable and relevant for protected area management the whole Amazon biome.<br/><br/>In terms of conserving biodiversity, addressing climate change, securing livelihoods and contributing toward the achievement of area-based Aichi Targets, this project is highly important because it seeks for well governed and effectively managed protected areas (Target 11) in order to safeguard both habitats and populations of species and for delivering important ecosystem services (Target  6). Furthermore, this project is aligned with Targets 5, 14 and 15, and there is the need for collaboration between neighboring protected areas and the adoption of mechanisms and commitments to strengthen the protected areas systems as natural solutions to climate change, in synergy with the CBD and other conventions according to CBD  Decision XI/24.<br/><br/><strong>Geographical and natural context</strong><br/><br/>The project takes place in the Amazon biome, a region widely recognized for its strategic importance in protecting biodiversity, in global climate regulation and in providing livelihood benefits to millions of people.  The biome covers 6.7 million Km2, spans across eight countries and one overseas territory.<br/><br/>It contains the largest remaining contiguous tropical rainforest on earth with an unparalleled diversity of species and habitats (more than 10% of the world’s known species, including more than 100.000 invertebrates, 40.000 plants and trees, and 3.000 fish), with (macro) species new to science appearing almost every day. Almost 20% of the world’s surface freshwater that reaches the oceans flows through the Amazon basin whose hydrological cycle plays a major role in stabilizing the regional and global climate.<br/><br/>The Amazon biome significantly contributes to maintaining critical ecosystem functions and provides ecological services that are crucial to society. It is home to more than 380 indigenous groups and its rich natural resources base provides a source of livelihoods for more than 44 million people.<br/><br/><strong>Role of Protected Areas</strong><br/><br/>Systems of Protected Areas are recognized as fundamental tools in the articulation and implementation of sustainable development and conservation strategies. They are also an essential part of the global response to climate change and other global change drivers. Protected areas (PAs) store 15% of terrestrial carbon and help address the cause of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By maintaining and supplying essential services upon which people depend – water supply, food and public health – they also contribute towards enhanced community-based adaptation in the face of climate change and play an important role in disaster risk reduction. <br/><br/>In line with the above, through the CBD Programme of Work on Protected Areas (PoWPA) signed through Decision VII/28 at CBD COP 7, Parties have agreed to support the creation and maintenance of comprehensive national and regional systems of protected areas, effectively managed and ecologically representative that contribute to achieving the CBD objectives and to reduce the current rate of biodiversity loss. Additionally, the 2011-2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity, agreed in Nagoya Japan at the 10th Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity, calls for the halt of biodiversity loss and includes 20 explicit targets (Aichi Targets) in which to measure progress. Several (if not all) of these targets require protected areas in order to be achieved. In particular, Aichi Target 11 requires a systematic approach to protected area design, management, monitoring and benefit sharing. <br/><br/>In the Amazon Region, the essential function of PAs is well recognized and the Amazon biome contains today 2.16 % of all PAs worldwide. 78% of PAs that were established in the world between 2003 and 2009 are to be found in the Amazon biome. The National System of Protected Areas in Brazil and the Brazilian Program of Protected Areas for the Amazon Region (ARPA)  in particular are widely recognized as successful examples.<br/><br/><strong>Project Building</strong><br/><br/>Based on the model offered by ARPA and the major opportunities presented by the CBD PoWPA, the Latin-American Network for Technical Cooperation in National Parks, other Protected Areas, Wild Flora and Fauna, otherwise known as REDPARQUES , in partnership with the CBD Secretariat, WWF and IUCN, and with the support and participation of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO) and the Community of Andean of Nations (CAN), led the development of an Ecosystem Based Vision of Conservation of Biological and Cultural Diversity of the Amazon Biome to contribute to the effective administration and management of protected areas systems and the maintenance of goods and services, integrity, functionality and resilience of  the Biome against the effects of natural and anthropogenic pressures and in the context of climate change. <br/><br/>This work began in August 2008 in Bogota (Colombia), where directors and technicians of the systems of protected areas of the Amazon countries came together and put forth some elements of the vision and agreed a program of work to assess progress in implementing elements of PoWPA at a regional level. A series of workshop bringing together various stakeholders was subsequently organised, including inter alia workshops on a) Regional opportunities of conservation in the Amazon biome, b) Integration of the vision of indigenous and local communities in this initiative c) analysis of the effectiveness of protected area management, and d) review of financing strategies for protected areas.<br/><br/>These events contributed towards the articulation of a joint regional conservation vision with four key areas of intervention (priority issues) and one cross cutting issue, and the articulation of its related 2010–2020 Action Plan, mentioned herewith:<br/><br/>1.\tConservation opportunities - Directing actions to plan, select, create, strengthen and manage the national and regional systems and sites of protected areas.<br/>2.\tGovernance, participation, equity and benefit sharing.<br/>3.\tFinancial sustainability.<br/>4.\tManagement effectiveness: standards, assessments and monitoring of protected areas.<br/>5.\tEcosystem services and climate change was identified as a cross cutting theme.<br/><br/>The Action Plan was built under a timeline of ten (10) years (2010-2020), which draws a set of actions on the short (1-4 years), medium (5-7 years) and long (7-10 years) term in order to achieve the PoWPA objectives and goals. Such conservation initiatives have been already recognized at high level meetings such as the CDB COP10 and by the Global Biodiversity Outlook 3, from the CDB Secretariat.<br/><br/><strong>Threats to biodiversity</strong><br/><br/>The Amazon today is increasingly threatened mainly due to the rapidly expanding global markets, the imminent realization of large-scale infrastructure projects coupled with poor planning, weak governance and lack of an integrated vision of sustainable development for the Amazon. These threats are contributing to significant deforestation and increased pressure on the natural resources and environmental services upon which millions of people depend.<br/><br/>Over the past 30 years, the Amazon has lost more than 520.000 Km2 of forest. This has continued since 1990 at an annual rate of up to 27.000 Km2 (an area nearly the size of Belgium). It is estimated that deforestation, including the burning of natural vegetation, is responsible for up to 20% of all global CO2 emissions. The Amazon’s forests store 90-140 billion tons of carbon and releasing even a portion of this would accelerate global warming significantly.<br/><br/>In addition, the combined effects of deforestation and climate change are predicted to result in severe impacts on the Amazon biome/region, such as increased fire incidence, habitat degradation, droughts and river flow changes leading to major shifts in hydrological systems, with potentially catastrophic consequences for local people, their forest resources and the whole region.<br/><br/><strong>Challenges</strong><br/><br/>The future of the region depends on maintaining the integrity of ecosystems, ecological processes, and the regional clime dynamic to be able to resist the threats and pressures from climate change and land use change from the demand for natural resources and economic development. Therefore, the challenge that the involved actors have while building an Ecosystem Based Vision of Conservation of Biological and Cultural Diversity of the Amazon Biome, is to build an efficient long term strategy based on well-articulated national action plans, that focus on the sharing of information and expertise (monitoring, build capacity for, and assist with reporting) to achieve regional implementation of the POWPA and related Aichi Targets.",

A series of workshop bringing together various stakeholders was subsequently organised, including inter alia workshops on a) Regional opportunities of conservation in the Amazon biome, b) Integration of the vision of indigenous and local communities in this initiative c) analysis of the effectiveness of protected area management, and d) review of financing strategies for protected areas.<br/><br/>These events contributed towards the articulation of a joint regional conservation vision with four key areas of intervention (priority issues) and one cross cutting issue, and the articulation of its related 2010–2020 Action Plan, mentioned herewith:<br/><br/>1.\tConservation opportunities - Directing actions to plan, select, create, strengthen and manage the national and regional systems and sites of protected areas.<br/>2.\tGovernance, participation, equity and benefit sharing.<br/>3.\tFinancial sustainability.<br/>4.\tManagement effectiveness: standards, assessments and monitoring of protected areas.<br/>5.\tEcosystem services and climate change was identified as a cross cutting theme.<br/><br/>The Action Plan was built under a timeline of ten (10) years (2010-2020), which draws a set of actions on the short (1-4 years), medium (5-7 years) and long (7-10 years) term in order to achieve the PoWPA objectives and goals. Such conservation initiatives have been already recognized at high level meetings such as the CDB COP10 and by the Global Biodiversity Outlook 3, from the CDB Secretariat.<br/><br/><strong>Threats to biodiversity</strong><br/><br/>The Amazon today is increasingly threatened mainly due to the rapidly expanding global markets, the imminent realization of large-scale infrastructure projects coupled with poor planning, weak governance and lack of an integrated vision of sustainable development for the Amazon. These threats are contributing to significant deforestation and increased pressure on the natural resources and environmental services upon which millions of people depend.<br/><br/>Over the past 30 years, the Amazon has lost more than 520.000 Km2 of forest. This has continued since 1990 at an annual rate of up to 27.000 Km2 (an area nearly the size of Belgium). It is estimated that deforestation, including the burning of natural vegetation, is responsible for up to 20% of all global CO2 emissions. The Amazon’s forests store 90-140 billion tons of carbon and releasing even a portion of this would accelerate global warming significantly.<br/><br/>In addition, the combined effects of deforestation and climate change are predicted to result in severe impacts on the Amazon biome/region, such as increased fire incidence, habitat degradation, droughts and river flow changes leading to major shifts in hydrological systems, with potentially catastrophic consequences for local people, their forest resources and the whole region.<br/><br/><strong>Challenges</strong><br/><br/>The future of the region depends on maintaining the integrity of ecosystems, ecological processes, and the regional clime dynamic to be able to resist the threats and pressures from climate change and land use change from the demand for natural resources and economic development. Therefore, the challenge that the involved actors have while building an Ecosystem Based Vision of Conservation of Biological and Cultural Diversity of the Amazon Biome, is to build an efficient long term strategy based on well-articulated national action plans, that focus on the sharing of information and expertise (monitoring, build capacity for, and assist with reporting) to achieve regional implementation of the POWPA and related Aichi Targets.",

Its wide range of habitats, ranging from coastal beaches and lowland forests to alpine meadows, together with its large size (almost 3 million hectares) makes it the best hope of conserving such rare Sumatran species as the Sumatran rhino, orangutan, tiger and elephant. The Leuser Ecosystem is also the focus of a new approach for conservation in Indonesia, in which the management of a given part, which lies in Aceh (about 90% of the total), is the responsibility of the Government of Aceh; more specifically, a professionally staffed management authority known by its acronym  BPKEL. This highly dedicated team of about 200 people has shown its effectiveness in reversing the forest destruction caused by illegal palm oil development, illegal logging, and inappropriate infrastructure. The Leuser Ecosystem is also a major carbon sink and has a mitigating impact on local climate. Enhancing this service, along with other environmental services such as natural beauty (for tourism) and fast flowing water (for run-of-river hydropower). This project aims to strengthen the management and financing of the Leuser Ecosystem while making its financing more sustainable.",
		"description": "The Leuser Ecosystem is the largest conservation area in SE Asia. At almost 3 million hectares, it encompasses a great diversity of habitats from coastal beaches, peat swamps, lowland forests, montane forests and alpine meadows. It is this mix of habitats that may account for its rich biodiversity and the fact that its is the last place remaining that has viable populations of Sumatran rhino, orangutan, tiger, elephant and clouded leopard in the same geographic area.  <br/><br/>Much has been achieved since the Leuser Ecosystem was designated by Presidential Decree in 1998, including the demarcation of boundaries in the field, the termination of all logging concessions and the development of a broad public constituency of support. But now the expansive and fertile lowlands (totalling some 500,000 hectares) are under severe threat from oil plantation interests and sponsored settlement along with the enabling infrastructure such as roads.

As part of the peace accord the management of the Leuser Ecosystem in Aceh was delegated to the provincial government, and the Aceh government in turn established a special management authority (BPKEL) to undertake this work. This is the first time in Indonesia where the management of a conservation area has been fully delegated to the provincial level, and it marks a very positive opportunity to build on local support and to utilise professionals (as opposed to civil servants) to undertake conservation management. The decree under which BPKEL was established also allows the organization to acquire funds from both private and public sources and in this way to become sufficiently capitalised to do a proper job. In the three years since its formation BPKEL has focused on building up its manpower with dedicated and skilful staff. It is clear now however that to deal with the growing significant funding gap is an urgent priority.<br/><br/>This project, if approved, would not only significantly develop the capacity of BPKEL in undertaking its conservation management responsibilities but would also address the growing challenges of integrating development with conservation, restoring essential wildlife corridors, and moving towards sustainable financing with a mixture of government allocations, and revenues generated from partnerships with the private sector.

		"ecological_contribution": "In contrast to many conservation areas, the Leuser Ecosystem was designed from the outset on the basis of the migration patterns of wide ranging species, such as elephants and fruit bats, and on the habitat needs to support viable populations of large mammals – Sumatran tiger, Sumatran Orangutan, and Sumatran Rhino. The area thus incorporates the key wildlife corridors in its design and is of sufficient size to support approximately 800 elephant, 400 tiger, and more than 1000 rhino  (although the current population of this species is currently only about 120 individuals). No other reserve has breeding populations of Sumatran rhino, and only recently have efforts been made to establish a second population of the Sumatran Orangutan (in Jambi province). While Sumatran tigers exist and breed elsewhere, their populations are locally small and the future of most of these isolated populations is in doubt. Aceh is realistically the last hope for the Sumatran elephant ; nowhere else is there sufficient habitat for these wide ranging species to move and access the forage to support large numbers. <br/><br/>The species mentioned above are also indicators of a great diversity of lesser species. There are seven species of hornbill in Leuser, one species of Argus pheasant, seven species of wild cat, eight varieties of Mango, six varieties of Durian, at least five kinds of citrus, etc. A study carried out by Y.Wind in the 1980s identified the lowlands of the Leuser Ecosystem as having some of the highest biodiversity in the whole of Sumatra.<br/><br/>In addition to harbouring such high biodiversity, the Leuser Ecosystem provides a regular water supply for some four million people including the industrial heartland of Aceh, its rivers formally supported high concentrations of fish and provided a major source of protein to the downstream communities, and it has a role in regulating local climate which has direct benefits for the growing of oil palm in areas outside the Leuser Ecosystem  <br/><br/>The standing carbon store in the Leuser Ecosystem has been estimated at around 1.5 billion tonnes. This does not include the carbon sequestered in the 160,000 hectares of deep peat swamps that are part of the Leuser Ecosystem.",

In addition, local people will be involved in all conservation activities such forest restoration, fire prevention (during the dry season), awareness generation events, research studies and censuses, and specific protection operations. BPKEL works with more than 40 local NGOs in its efforts to build a solid constituency of support for the conservation of the Leuser Ecosystem.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact all planning involves local community leaders as well as local government officials. The Leuser Ecosystem Management Plan took two year years to complete on account of spending considerable time with local communities, local officials, and informal leaders. <br/><br/>As stated above, the Project will promote the participation of the private sector and will ensure that the benefits of this partnership will benefit the local communities. This will however not involve providing regular cash gifts to individuals (there are at least two million people living around the Leuser Ecosystem). Neither will it hand out cash gifts to communities – there are more than 2000 villages near the borders of the Leuser Ecosystem. Instead, the benefits from REDD credits (if in fact a market develops), ecotourism, sustainable energy and agricultural product processing, will create employment opportunities for local people and contribute to a growing regional economy. Of course the indirect benefits from ecological services can not be underestimated and it has been calculated that, if Leuser Ecosystem is properly protected, 60% of the value of its services accrue to local communities.",

The Decree also provides for BPKEL to derive fees, royalties and/or revenues from such commercial activities.  <br/><br/>Under a Joint Venture Agreement signed in 2008, the Government of Aceh and the private sector partner will develop businesses in the fields of Eco-tourism, renewable energy, and REDD to derive commercial returns. The costs of undertaking such business will include an agreed fee (in the order of two million dollars per year) to ensure the protection of the source of these services – namely the Leuser Ecosystem. The profits from these enterprises will be mainly reinvested in developing new sustainable enterprises with an aim to developing the local economy rather than providing direct payments to local communities. The current private sector partner is currently under review on account of questions concerning the ability to fully capitalise the joint venture company. <br/><br/>In addition to revenues and fees, the Government of Aceh and the National Government are both obliged by law (Act No 11, 2006) to provide regular budget allocations. At the moment these allocations total around 500,000 US dollars per year but this is inadequate to cover even routine expenses. BPKEL is working with the Aceh parliament to consider much more realistic funding in the future.<br/><br/>To give confidence to some future donors – both private and institutional – the project will propose the establishment of a Purpose Trust in which funds for the conservation of Leuser might be held and disbursed as appropriate.",

In a follow up Government Regulation (PP 27 2008) The Leuser Ecosystem in Aceh is identified as one of these areas and is given the highest rating – as a National Strategic Area – on account of its biodiversity and its importance as a water source. All future planning and activities in the Leuser Ecosystem (in Aceh) must follow these regulations. <br/><br/>The legal framework for REDD in Indonesia is still in flux with no final legislation being created. Aceh will conform to the National procedures and will of course register any credits generated.

					"title": "Progressing toward Sustainable Conservation of the Leuser Ecosystem",
					"summary": "The Leuser Ecosystem, situated near the northern tip of the island of Sumatra, is the largest conservation area in Southeast Asia, and arguably one of the richest in biological diversity. Its wide range of habitats, ranging from coastal beaches and lowland forests to alpine meadows, together with its large size (almost 3 million hectares) makes it the best hope of conserving such rare Sumatran species as the Sumatran rhino, orangutan, tiger and elephant. The Leuser Ecosystem is also the focus of a new approach for conservation in Indonesia, in which the management of a given part, which lies in Aceh (about 90% of the total), is the responsibility of the Government of Aceh; more specifically, a professionally staffed management authority known by its acronym  BPKEL. This highly dedicated team of about 200 people has shown its effectiveness in reversing the forest destruction caused by illegal palm oil development, illegal logging, and inappropriate infrastructure. The Leuser Ecosystem is also a major carbon sink and has a mitigating impact on local climate. Enhancing this service, along with other environmental services such as natural beauty (for tourism) and fast flowing water (for run-of-river hydropower). This project aims to strengthen the management and financing of the Leuser Ecosystem while making its financing more sustainable.",
					"description": "The Leuser Ecosystem is the largest conservation area in SE Asia. At almost 3 million hectares, it encompasses a great diversity of habitats from coastal beaches, peat swamps, lowland forests, montane forests and alpine meadows. It is this mix of habitats that may account for its rich biodiversity and the fact that its is the last place remaining that has viable populations of Sumatran rhino, orangutan, tiger, elephant and clouded leopard in the same geographic area.  <br/><br/>Much has been achieved since the Leuser Ecosystem was designated by Presidential Decree in 1998, including the demarcation of boundaries in the field, the termination of all logging concessions and the development of a broad public constituency of support. But now the expansive and fertile lowlands (totalling some 500,000 hectares) are under severe threat from oil plantation interests and sponsored settlement along with the enabling infrastructure such as roads. In some areas local communities are encroaching into the steep foothills of the mountainous core. <br/><br/>Almost 90% of the Leuser Ecosystem lies in the province of Aceh which until 2005 suffered from civil war. As part of the peace accord the management of the Leuser Ecosystem in Aceh was delegated to the provincial government, and the Aceh government in turn established a special management authority (BPKEL) to undertake this work. This is the first time in Indonesia where the management of a conservation area has been fully delegated to the provincial level, and it marks a very positive opportunity to build on local support and to utilise professionals (as opposed to civil servants) to undertake conservation management. The decree under which BPKEL was established also allows the organization to acquire funds from both private and public sources and in this way to become sufficiently capitalised to do a proper job. In the three years since its formation BPKEL has focused on building up its manpower with dedicated and skilful staff. It is clear now however that to deal with the growing significant funding gap is an urgent priority.<br/><br/>This project, if approved, would not only significantly develop the capacity of BPKEL in undertaking its conservation management responsibilities but would also address the growing challenges of integrating development with conservation, restoring essential wildlife corridors, and moving towards sustainable financing with a mixture of government allocations, and revenues generated from partnerships with the private sector. If successful the contribution to the mitigation of climate change would be significant.",

		"description": "Wildlife has an intrinsic environmental value, as well as its present and potential revenue generation, contributing 75% of the 10% earnings in GDP from Tourism activities. Kenya’s wildlife is one of the richest and most diversified in Africa, with several of its protected areas and wetlands internationally renowned as World Heritage Sites and RAMSAR sites. Protected areas have long been seen as successful in conservation of wildlife and environmental sustainability. Wildlife covers an area of about 8% of Kenya’s landmass. The major concern in wildlife is the loss of corridors, habitat degradation, security, seasonability of tourism and infrastructure.<br/> <br/>Climate Change poses major challenges in the economy, human life and wildlife and on environment thereby affecting Kenya’s social and economic development. While Kenya’s contribution to the Green House Gases (GHGs) is minimal in comparison to developed countries, it is adversely affected by effects of Climate Change. There is need to develop appropriate, detection, prediction, adaption and mitigation measures to reduce the negative impact of the adverse effects. <br/><br/>Kenya has 53 protected areas with 6 marine and the rest are terrestrial parks. The national parks and reserves act as important carbon sinks in the country. The protected areas represent 8% of Kenya’s landmass. <br/><br/>The Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been identified by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the RAMSAR Convention, the Nairobi Convention and the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI) as key tools in the conservation and management of marine and coastal biodiversity. The MPAs of Kenya harbor coral reefs and associated ecosystems such as mangroves and seagrasses that are among the most biologically diverse and economically important ecosystems in the Earth’s oceans. Taken collectively, these ecosystems support important finfish and shellfish fisheries, play a key role in biodiversity protection, sediment catchment and shoreline protection, and directly or indirectly support coastal tourism which represents an important source of foreign exchange. These marine ecosystems are also particularly vulnerable to overexploitation, and suffer the impacts of destructive exploitation, siltation, pollution, unplanned tourism and urban development, all of which are aggravated by climate change and an ever-increasing human population. Because Kenyan MPAs only cover ~ 8.7% of the coastal shelf area and 3.1% (~ 925 km2) of the total protected area surface in Kenya, they are of crucial importance to the protected area system and were prioritized by the national protected area agency the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) within a network of coastal PA. These MPAs are effectiveness in protecting coral reef biodiversity as evidenced by significantly higher diversity, abundance and biomass of coral reef fish, coral species diversity and cover and lower densities of sea urchins within MPAs than reefs outside the MPAs as well as endemic species of fish and coral. <br/><br/>Additional important attributes that have not been evaluated include carbon sequestration by coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass beds, the potential for medicinal products and the recreational and aesthetic value of these areas. Although no country-wide geographical prioritization of biodiversity has been carried out in Kenya, the high dependence of coastal communities on marine resources, the importance of MPAs for tourism (the mainstay of the Kenyan economy), fisheries and biodiversity and other ecosystem services, and the serious threat of climate change on coral reefs and associated ecosystems increase the urgency for strengthening the management of Kenyan MPAs. The effect of climate change were particularly manifested during the 1998 El Niño Southern Oscillation bleaching event that caused widespread hard coral mortality across the WIO region.",

The MPAs of Kenya harbor coral reefs and associated ecosystems such as mangroves and seagrasses that are among the most biologically diverse and economically important ecosystems in the Earth’s oceans. Taken collectively, these ecosystems support important finfish and shellfish fisheries, play a key role in biodiversity protection, sediment catchment and shoreline protection, and directly or indirectly support coastal tourism which represents an important source of foreign exchange. These marine ecosystems are also particularly vulnerable to overexploitation, and suffer the impacts of destructive exploitation, siltation, pollution, unplanned tourism and urban development, all of which are aggravated by climate change and an ever-increasing human population. Because Kenyan MPAs only cover ~ 8.7% of the coastal shelf area and 3.1% (~ 925 km2) of the total protected area surface in Kenya, they are of crucial importance to the protected area system and were prioritized by the national protected area agency the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) within a network of coastal PA. These MPAs are effectiveness in protecting coral reef biodiversity as evidenced by significantly higher diversity, abundance and biomass of coral reef fish, coral species diversity and cover and lower densities of sea urchins within MPAs than reefs outside the MPAs as well as endemic species of fish and coral. <br/><br/>Additional important attributes that have not been evaluated include carbon sequestration by coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass beds, the potential for medicinal products and the recreational and aesthetic value of these areas. Although no country-wide geographical prioritization of biodiversity has been carried out in Kenya, the high dependence of coastal communities on marine resources, the importance of MPAs for tourism (the mainstay of the Kenyan economy), fisheries and biodiversity and other ecosystem services, and the serious threat of climate change on coral reefs and associated ecosystems increase the urgency for strengthening the management of Kenyan MPAs. The effect of climate change were particularly manifested during the 1998 El Niño Southern Oscillation bleaching event that caused widespread hard coral mortality across the WIO region.",

Ce projet vise, par des approches qualitatives et quantitaves à échelle nationale, à améliorer la représentativité écologique du système d'aires protégées tunisien et à assurer une gestion efficace et durable.",
		"description": "La Tunisie, pays aride, soumise à l’influence du climat méditerranéen avec une moyenne de pluviométrie n’excédant  pas les 200 mm/an, dispose d’une variété spécifique et écosystémique bien importante variant du Nord au Sud. L’actualisation de l’étude nationale sur la diversité biologique en 2009, a décelé que le nombre d’espèces animales et végétales terrestres et aquatiques identifiés jusque là s’élève à environ 7200 espèces. Ces dernières se trouvent réparties sur 69 écosystèmes naturels et environ 12 agro systèmes.<br/>Toutefois, cette richesse est soumise à plusieurs menaces et sources de dégradation spécifiques et universelles, dont on cite les suivants :<br/>-\tLa fragilité héritée de l’époque coloniale marqué par une exploitation minière intense et une utilisation irrationnelle des ressources biologiques qui a altéré et affaiblie la diversité et la résilience de la plupart des écosystèmes naturels; <br/>-\tLes facteurs climatiques et les phénomènes naturels extrêmes considérés parmi les facteurs décisifs qui affectent la diversité biologique et les écosystèmes; en Tunisie, on enregistre des périodes de sécheresses prolongées, des températures estivales excessives, des pluies torrentielles et des invasions d’espèces terrestres, marines et aquatiques.<br/>-\tLa destruction et la fragmentation des écosystèmes et des agro systèmes par l’urbanisation et le changement de vocation des terrains naturels au profit de l’extension agricole et de l’urbanisme.<br/>-\tL’érosion génétique et la raréfaction des espèces végétales et animales domestiques cultivées et élevées par des pratiques et des approches de gestion inappropriées (monoculture, orientation vers les espèces les plus productives, abandon des espèces locales et autochtone, etc.), <br/>-\tL’utilisation excessive et non rationnelle des éléments de la diversité biologique (surpâturage, valorisation des espèces médicinales et sous-bois…) <br/>-\tLes modes de gestion actuels ne sont pas adéquats manifesté surtout par une faible intégration de la population environnante ce qui a crée une relation un peu tendu exprimé par des réactions négatives au niveau de quelques aires protégées (Bouhedma, Chammbi, Ichkeul,..) lors de la révolution tunisienne du 14 janvier 2011.<br/>-\tAussi la grande majorité des aires protégées ne disposent pas de plans de gestion et d’aménagement et même celles qui en disposent, n’ont pas trouvé les moyens de les appliquer.  <br/><br/>Le présent projet vise à renforcer le système des aires protégées en Tunisie notamment au niveau des aspects suivants : <br/><br/>1.\tAspect quantitatif <br/><br/>Actuellement la Tunisie compte 43 aires protégées terrestres désignées  (17 parcs nationaux et 26 réserves naturelles). Le taux de couverture des aires protégées est autour de 7 %. Toutefois, la représentativité écologique de ce  système mérite d’être évaluée et améliorée. En effet la DGEQV a entamé, en septembre 2010 (étude en cours), la réalisation d’une étude portant sur l’analyse et l’évaluation de la représentativité écologique et l’efficacité de gestion des aires protégées. Cette étude permettra d’avancer des résultats, des orientations et des recommandations visant à intégrer de nouveaux sites d’intérêt écologique et biologique au niveau du réseau national des aires protégées outre l’amélioration de l’approche de protection et de gestion des aires protégées existantes. Des révisions des limites et d’éventuelles extensions des aires protégées déjà crées sont aussi attendues.  <br/>D’autre part, concernant les aires protégées marines et côtières et vu le manque actuel de capacités techniques et financières,  il est recommandé que le présent projet appuiera  les acteurs nationaux concernés dans leur démarche d’exploration, de création et de gestion de ces espaces marins et côtiers conformément aux standards internationaux et aux spécificités du contexte national, régional et local de la Tunisie <br/><br/>2.\tAspect qualitatif <br/>L’efficacité de gestion : Consciente de l’importance de conduire une gestion saine et efficace permettant l’atteinte des objectifs de création des aires protégées, une étude a été engagé en 2010 portant sur l’évaluation de l’efficacité de gestion au niveau du réseau national des aires protégées. Dans ce cadre une analyse approfondie des approches de gestion actuellement adoptés sera réalisée. L’efficacité de gestion sera analysée à travers les approches et les méthodologies d’évaluation les plus recommandées à l’échelle internationale telles que celles du WWF et de l’UICN.<br/><br/>Le système financier<br/>En Tunisie, le système des aires protégées ne bénéficie pas d’un mécanisme financier indépendant et durable. A ce sujet, le financement des activités ayant trait aux  aires protégées est faiblement assuré par l’État dans le cadre du budget annuel du Ministère de l’Agriculture, des Ressources Hydrauliques et de la Pêche. En effet, une petite allocation financière d’un montant de 70 000 $ US est accordée annuellement à tout le système des aires protégées. Ce mécanisme de financement s’avère être très limité pour subvenir aux besoins des aires protégées, et permettre la mise en œuvre de leurs plans de gestion.<br/>La majorité des fonds mobilisés pour les aires protégées jusque là proviennent des projets de coopération bilatérale et multilatérale (coopération japonaise, FEM, PNUD, Banque Mondiale, etc.)<br/>Partant de ce constat, le présent projet sera appelé également à engager une réflexion en vue de soumettre des propositions concrètes pour améliorer le système de financement des aires protégées existant et garantir sa durabilité. <br/><br/>Les plans d’aménagement et de gestion des aires protégées  en Tunisie<br/>L’identification, la délimitation  et la création d’aires protégées restent toujours une étape fondamentale mais insuffisante en l’absence d’un plan d’aménagement et de gestion du site. L’élaboration et la mise en œuvre de  plans d’aménagement et de gestion sont d’une importance cruciale pour garantir la survie du site et définir les modalités de gestion les plus appropriés dans le temps et dans l’espace afin de permettre au système des aires protégées de jouer le rôle qui lui est assigné.  <br/>Actuellement en Tunisie, seules 4  aires protégées terrestres disposent de plans de gestion et d’aménagement réalisés dans le cadre de projets de coopération internationale et malheureusement ne sont pas encore appliqués. Le reste des aires protégées, faute de moyens financier n’ont pas pu bénéficier de tels documents.",

		"summary": "La Reserve de biosphère de Yangambi fait face à un certain nombre de menaces causées par le braconnage, l’agriculture itinérante sur brûlis, la recherche des produits forestiers non ligneux, l’extraction artisanale des ressources minières (diamants) et l’exploitation artisanale de bois d’œuvre.<br/><br/>La réhabilitation de la Reserve de Yangambi permettra de lutter contre ces menaces à travers notamment le renforcement des capacités de gestion du personnel, l’implication des communautés locales à la gestion des ressources et la création des activités alternatives.",
		"description": "La Reserve de biosphère de Yangambi se situe à ± 100km à l’Ouest de la ville de Kisangani dans la province Orientale en RDC et correspond à une étendue comprise entre 24°16’95’’ et 25°08’48’’ longitude Est et 0°38’77’’ et 1°10’20’’ latitude Nord, avec des altitudes variables entre 400 et 500m. Sa  superficie est estimée à environ  220.000 hectares et se caractérise par un relief en plateau disséqué par des vallées à fonds plats et larges qui sont occupés par des cours d’eau dont les principaux forment des affluents tributaires du fleuve Congo. sa position topographique lui confère quatre séries géomorphologiques classées selon la granulométrie et la minéralogie des sols : sols de la série Yangambi avec de texture argilo-sablonneuse (sols de plateau), sols de la série Yakonde avec de texture sablo-argileuse (sols de haut versant), sols de la série Isalowe avec des sédiments nettement sablonneux (sols s’étendant de haut versant jusqu’au fond des vallées), et sols du complexe Bohondé-Boto avec des matériaux colluvionnés ou des alluvions récentes ( sols des fonds des rivières). Le climat y est de type équatorial, chaud et humide avec des précipitations annuelles oscillant autour de 1800mm et de température de 25°C. Ce climat fait que la réserve puisse abriter une  végétation très dense et variable qui va des formations herbacées aux  forets ombrophiles sempervirentes en passant par des jachères arbustives, des  forêts secondaires (jeunes et adultes), des forêts sur sol hydromorphes et des forêts denses semi-décidues. Sa flore est composée de plus de 2100 espèces parmi lesquelles on y retrouve des plantes alimentaires, médicinales, de bois d’œuvre et utilisées dans l’artisanat.  La faune est très riche et diversifiée. On y rencontre des espèces emblématiques de la conservation et même protégées par CITES, notamment : Okapia jonhstoni (Okapi), Panthera pardus (Léopard), Crocodylus niloticus (Crocodile deu Nil), Manis gigantea (Pangolin géant), Hippopotamus amphibius (Hippopotame), Pan paniscus (Bonobos), etc.<br/><br/>Malheureusement, cette réserve fait aujourd’hui face à un certain nombre de menaces causées essentiellement par le braconnage, l’agriculture itinérante sur brûlis, la recherche des produits forestiers non ligneux, l’extraction artisanale des ressources minières (diamants) et l’exploitation artisanale de bois d’œuvre qui ne cessent de s'amplifier au fil de temps.  Cette situation est surtout favorisée par le faible niveau de revenu des populations riveraines, le coût relativement élevé des sources d'énergie autres que le bois, et surtout l'accroissement démographique  qui entoure la réserve se traduisant par une  consommation accrue de bois de chauffe. Ce qui, avec le braconnage, l’agriculture itinérante et l'exploitation artisanale irrationnelle des ressources, entraîne une dégradation forestière très importante et une diminution sensible de la faune sauvage avec comme conséquence une déstabilisation de l’écosystème.<br/><br/>Ces menaces sont exacerbées par la mauvaise gouvernance environnementale et l’absence des capacités du personnel commis à la réserve afin de la gérer d’une manière durable. Et également, depuis plus de deux décennies, cette réserve  ne bénéficie plus de l’appui ni en moyens financiers, ni en matériels, ni en formation du personnel, ni en toute autre forme d’assistance. Le peu d’équipements mobiliers et immobiliers existants  sont dans un état de délabrement total.<br/><br/>Il convient de noter enfin qu’aucune stratégie d’approches n’est définie pour faire participer les communautés locales dans la gestion de cette réserve. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>CONTRIBUTION ÉCOLOGIQUE<br/>Veuillez indiquer la mesure dans laquelle ces aires représentent une priorité écologique pour le système national des aires protégées, sur la base de sa contribution à la représentation, la connectivité, la viabilité et / ou  son indispensabilité écologiques dans le système des aires protégées. Si possible,  référez vous à l'analyse des lacunes écologiques ou d'autres établissements de priorités géographiques et joignez y des pièces justificatives.<br/><br/>Parmi les thèmes prioritaires retenus dans la stratégie nationale et plan d’action de la biodiversité de la RD Congo figurent notamment la préservation des écosystèmes et ses éléments constitutifs en aires protégées. A cet effet, l’objectif est d’atteindre 15% de couverture nationale en aires protégées. La poursuite de cet objectif ne peut être garantie que si et seulement les aires protégées existantes se trouvent dans un état viable, c’est-à-dire ayant les statuts viables des aires protégées selon l’UICN.

					"description": "La Reserve de biosphère de Yangambi se situe à ± 100km à l’Ouest de la ville de Kisangani dans la province Orientale en RDC et correspond à une étendue comprise entre 24°16’95’’ et 25°08’48’’ longitude Est et 0°38’77’’ et 1°10’20’’ latitude Nord, avec des altitudes variables entre 400 et 500m. Sa  superficie est estimée à environ  220.000 hectares et se caractérise par un relief en plateau disséqué par des vallées à fonds plats et larges qui sont occupés par des cours d’eau dont les principaux forment des affluents tributaires du fleuve Congo. sa position topographique lui confère quatre séries géomorphologiques classées selon la granulométrie et la minéralogie des sols : sols de la série Yangambi avec de texture argilo-sablonneuse (sols de plateau), sols de la série Yakonde avec de texture sablo-argileuse (sols de haut versant), sols de la série Isalowe avec des sédiments nettement sablonneux (sols s’étendant de haut versant jusqu’au fond des vallées), et sols du complexe Bohondé-Boto avec des matériaux colluvionnés ou des alluvions récentes ( sols des fonds des rivières). Le climat y est de type équatorial, chaud et humide avec des précipitations annuelles oscillant autour de 1800mm et de température de 25°C. Ce climat fait que la réserve puisse abriter une  végétation très dense et variable qui va des formations herbacées aux  forets ombrophiles sempervirentes en passant par des jachères arbustives, des  forêts secondaires (jeunes et adultes), des forêts sur sol hydromorphes et des forêts denses semi-décidues. Sa flore est composée de plus de 2100 espèces parmi lesquelles on y retrouve des plantes alimentaires, médicinales, de bois d’œuvre et utilisées dans l’artisanat.  La faune est très riche et diversifiée. On y rencontre des espèces emblématiques de la conservation et même protégées par CITES, notamment : Okapia jonhstoni (Okapi), Panthera pardus (Léopard), Crocodylus niloticus (Crocodile deu Nil), Manis gigantea (Pangolin géant), Hippopotamus amphibius (Hippopotame), Pan paniscus (Bonobos), etc.<br/><br/>Malheureusement, cette réserve fait aujourd’hui face à un certain nombre de menaces causées essentiellement par le braconnage, l’agriculture itinérante sur brûlis, la recherche des produits forestiers non ligneux, l’extraction artisanale des ressources minières (diamants) et l’exploitation artisanale de bois d’œuvre qui ne cessent de s'amplifier au fil de temps.  Cette situation est surtout favorisée par le faible niveau de revenu des populations riveraines, le coût relativement élevé des sources d'énergie autres que le bois, et surtout l'accroissement démographique  qui entoure la réserve se traduisant par une  consommation accrue de bois de chauffe. Ce qui, avec le braconnage, l’agriculture itinérante et l'exploitation artisanale irrationnelle des ressources, entraîne une dégradation forestière très importante et une diminution sensible de la faune sauvage avec comme conséquence une déstabilisation de l’écosystème.<br/><br/>Ces menaces sont exacerbées par la mauvaise gouvernance environnementale et l’absence des capacités du personnel commis à la réserve afin de la gérer d’une manière durable. Et également, depuis plus de deux décennies, cette réserve  ne bénéficie plus de l’appui ni en moyens financiers, ni en matériels, ni en formation du personnel, ni en toute autre forme d’assistance. Le peu d’équipements mobiliers et immobiliers existants  sont dans un état de délabrement total.<br/><br/>Il convient de noter enfin qu’aucune stratégie d’approches n’est définie pour faire participer les communautés locales dans la gestion de cette réserve. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>CONTRIBUTION ÉCOLOGIQUE<br/>Veuillez indiquer la mesure dans laquelle ces aires représentent une priorité écologique pour le système national des aires protégées, sur la base de sa contribution à la représentation, la connectivité, la viabilité et / ou  son indispensabilité écologiques dans le système des aires protégées.

		"title": "MARINE PROTECTED AREAS STRENGTHENING PROJECT-KENYA",
		"summary": "In addition to protecting coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass beds, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in Kenya have additional biodiversity attributes including; protecting the only remaining population of dugong in Kenya in the Kiunga MPA, protecting key feeding and breeding grounds for sea turtles in the Kiunga, Malindi-Watamu and Mombasa MPAs and protecting part of the largest mangrove forest on the Kenyan coast.   Additional important attributes that have not been evaluated include carbon sequestration by coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass beds, the potential for medicinal products and the recreational and aesthetic value of these areas.  Although no country-wide geographical prioritization of biodiversity has been carried out in Kenya, the high dependence of coastal communities on marine resources, the importance of MPAs for tourism (the mainstay of the Kenyan economy), fisheries and biodiversity and other ecosystem services, and the serious threat of climate change on coral reefs and associated ecosystems increase the urgency for strengthening the management of Kenyan MPAs.",
		"description": "Coastal communities on the Kenyan coast have traditionally had a high dependence on marine resources as a primary source of food and income. The level of pressure on these resources has increased as the population has grown and development has expanded, leading to increased degradation of coral reefs and associated ecosystems. The Kenya government established Marine Parks that are managed as no-take areas, and Marine Reserves that allow for traditional fishing methods. Historically, Kenyan MPAs were designated by the government through the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), usually due to their importance in relation to coastal development, or their attractiveness for tourism purposes.  However, lack of due attention to resident fishing communities and other stakeholders has resulted in resentment and subsequent conflicts between MPA management and stakeholders, as well as the inability of the MPAs to fully meet their conservation and management objectives.  Management planning that involved stakeholders was not undertaken until 2000 while well intentioned, these plans were not sufficiently institutionalized and lacked adequate stakeholder buy-in that is critical to achieving both biodiversity goals and local socioeconomic goals for communities reliant on these MPAs.  <br/><br/>Multiple or cumulative human impacts including the effects of global warming can lessen the long-term resilience of marine ecosystems such as coral reefs and mangroves by altering their capacity to recover and maintain ecosystem function following disturbance. So MPAs are more effective when set within a broader management framework such as Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) and uses holistic approaches such as the Ecosystem approach. Although the new Kenyan Fisheries and Ocean Policy and the new ICZM policy make reference to ecosystem management, experience in the use of these approaches is lacking in Kenya. The implementation of a network of MPAs could achieve an ICM framework. Some of the common challenges encountered in the management of MPAs in Kenya include; <br/>• Ecological representation; Marine biodiversity is under-represented in MPAs and there was little attempt to address their management in terms of unique or endemic species, connectivity between sites, important migratory or charismatic species, or other trans-boundary management issues, the impacts of global climate change (e.g. coral bleaching, mangrove die-off, sea-level rise). <br/>• Loss and degradation of marine habitats; Critical marine ecosystems such as coral reefs, seagrass beds and mangrove forests are threatened with loss of biodiversity due to environmental and anthropogenic causes. Factors including poorly regulated fishing in marine reserves, use of destructive fishing gears, sediment inputs from land, climate change induced coral bleaching and mangrove die-off, coastal erosion from poorly planned coastal developments amongst others decrease the effectiveness of MPAs. <br/>• Systematic assessment and monitoring: Currently some ecological monitoring of coral reefs and some human impacts is carried out by KWS and partners, however, other ecosystems such as seagrass beds and mangroves and charismatic species such as sea turtles and marine mammals receive less attention. <br/>• MPA network: Kenyan MPAs are managed as individual units with little integration across MPAs which limits their ability to implement standard regulations and management interventions, and to share experiences and find common solutions for management challenges. Under the framework of the Nairobi Convention, a National Coral Reef task force (NCRTF) that includes relevant government and stakeholder representatives was establised that could be used as a vehicle to drive the harmonization and integration of the MPAs into a functional national network.<br/>• Outdated MPA management plans; The MPA plans of Kenya were developed in 2000 but the ecological, institutional, political and social environment has changed dramatically in the last 10 years. For example, there are new policies, laws and regulations (especially the Beach management unit regulation, Wildlife Policy, and Fisheries and Ocean policy and ICZM policy) that have the potential to impact MPAs, communities are more knowledgeable about their rights and environmental issues, improvements in governance and the higher pace of development all have implications for the management of MPAs<br/>• Increasing rates of conflicts; Social, economic and political conflicts regularly arise around Kenyan MPAs that undermine and sometimes totally obstruct, management and conservation objectives. The ability to understand and address conflicts as they occur at each stage in the management process needs to be developed for the successful conservation and management of MPAs.<br/>• Inadequate MPA management training and career opportunities; Although some MPA managers have received training in basic protected area management, most lack technical knowledge about MPA governance and adaptive experiential learning limiting their ability to manage MPAs. In addition, the professionalization of MPA management through regional programs such as the WIO Certification of MPA staff (WIO COMPASS) needs to be recognized within KWS and institutionalized as a career development tool.<br/>• Limited involvement of Indigenous communities; The level of community involvement in MPA management is low reducing the potential support by local communities. Recently, due to increased awareness of the benefits of closures, acceptance of MPAs has increased and communities have started showing an interest in community area management (CMA). A number of CMAs are now being piloted on the Kenyan coast.  The institutional framework and formalization of these CMAs inline with current policies including the BMU regulations would have to be resolved to increase community participation in marine conservation.<br/>• Lack of harmonized policies and regulations; There is inadequate institutional, legislative and enforcement capacity within a broader national management framework. While Kenya has numerous environmental laws and policies, most of them are in conflict and lack inter-sector coordination mechanisms. Institutional mandates also overlap and enforcement is weak which limits the effectiveness of management interventions.<br/>• Uncoordinated enforcement and surveillance; Despite relatively robust legal instruments that protect marine biodiversity, enforcement of regulations is weak in the reserves and for species of special concern that occur outside MPAs.  Joint patrols could decrease infringement of regulations but the mechanisms for such patrols needs to be developed.<br/>• Uncoordinated investments and financing; Kenyan MPAs lack adequate funds for development activities including community livelihood initiatives.  This limits the ability of the MPAs to build their own capacity to carry out conservation activities as well as to strengthen existing partnership by the demonstration of tangible benefits.  Few viable institutional, business or enterprise models have emerged around the MPAs’. It is anticipated that this project will provide a harmonized investment strategy that will guide the growth of enterprises in and around the MPA's. <br/>• Lack of coordination at the national level; there are numerous organizations, initiatives and projects working on marine conservation and management related programs in Kenya. The newly formed NCRTF, which is tasked with promoting coordination and harmonizing conservation and management activities for coral reefs, could take on this role since coral reefs are the dominant ecosystem in MPAs. In addition although Kenya has a new ICM policy few organizations are currently using this new approach. <br/><br/>If Kenya is to successfully build an effective network of MPAs and meet its commitments to WSSD 2012 agreement and other biodiversity agreements, there is a need for an overall national strategic approach. This approach needs to improve the current understanding of the status of MPAs, to establish a national mechanism to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of these MPAs, to identify the factors that are preventing the effective management of these MPAs (i.e. barriers) at different stages in the management process and to develop appropriate strategies to address these barriers. <br/>The national strategy should aim to improve the success of existing MPAs, progress the implementation of new MPAs, and identify and address gaps in the management network. The strategy should make best use of existing scientific knowledge and current management practice (e.g. adaptive management to capture bleaching-resistant sites, and to promote resilience), and capitalizes on diverse global experiences. The strategy also needs to build the institutional strength and capacity to plan, legislate, enforce, as well as address barriers and conflicts and to monitor and evaluate management. By demonstrating adaptive management programming based on assessment and evaluation of management effectiveness in the MPAs of Kenya, the present project will contribute to the effective management of natural resource and enhance livelihoods in Kenya.

		"ecological_contribution": "Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) have been identified by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the RAMSAR Convention, the Nairobi Convention and the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI) as key tools in the conservation and management of marine and coastal biodiversity. Kenya is a signatory to these conventions as well as a founder member of ICRI.  Although Kenya has 53 protected areas, only six; Kiunga, Malindi, Watamu, Mombasa, Diani-Chale and Kisite-Mpunguti are marine.  The MPAs are either gazetted as national marine parks that are managed as no-take areas (IUCN category II) or national marine reserves that are managed as fisheries regulated areas (IUCN category IIV). <br/>The MPAs of Kenya harbor coral reefs and associated ecosystems such as mangroves and seagrasses that are among the most biologically diverse and economically important ecosystems in the Earth’s oceans. Taken collectively, these ecosystems support important finfish and shellfish fisheries, play a key role in biodiversity protection, sediment catchment and shoreline protection, and directly or indirectly support coastal tourism which represents an important source of foreign exchange.  These marine ecosystems are also particularly vulnerable to overexploitation, and suffer the impacts of destructive exploitation, siltation, pollution, unplanned tourism and urban development, all of which are aggravated by climate change and an ever-increasing human population. Because Kenyan MPAs only cover ~ 8.7% of the coastal shelf area and 3.1%  (~ 925 km2) of the total protected area surface in Kenya, they are of crucial importance to the protected area system and were prioritized by the national protected area agency the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) within a network of coastal PA as the ‘Coast Conservation Area’. Other key international biodiversity endorsements include; Biosphere reserve designation for the Malindi-Watamu and Kiunga MPAs and Important Bird Area (IBA) designation for Kiunga, Watamu, Diani and Shimoni. The importance of coral reefs and mangroves to the nation are further emphasized in the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, the State of the Coast report and by the establishment of a National Coral Reef Task Force (CRTF) inline with the decision (CP. 3/2 ‘Protection of coral reefs and associated ecosystems’) of the Nairobi Convention and the ICRI call to action (www.icriforum.org). At the regional level, strengthening and increasing the effectiveness of MPAs are included in the Strategic Action Plan for the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) region that was recently signed by 9 Ministers of the WIO region, as well as in the Regional Coral Reef Action Strategy for the WIO.<br/><br/>In addition to protecting coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass beds, MPA's in Kenya have additional biodiversity attributes including; protecting the only remaining population of dugong in Kenya in the Kiunga MPA (Photo 1), protecting key feeding and breeding grounds for sea turtles in the Kiunga, Malindi-Watamu and Mombasa MPAs and protecting part of the largest mangrove forest on the Kenyan coast.   These MPAs are effectiveness in protecting coral reef biodiversity as evidenced by significantly higher diversity, abundance and biomass of coral reef fish, coral species diversity and cover and lower densities of sea urchins within MPAs than reefs outside the MPAs as well as endemic species of fish and coral. Additional important attributes that have not been evaluated include carbon sequestration by coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass beds, the potential for medicinal products and the recreational and aesthetic value of these areas.  Although no country-wide geographical prioritization of biodiversity has been carried out in Kenya, the high dependence of coastal communities on marine resources, the importance of MPAs for tourism (the mainstay of the Kenyan economy), fisheries and biodiversity and other ecosystem services, and the serious threat of climate change on coral reefs and associated ecosystems increase the urgency for strengthening the management of Kenyan MPAs. The effect of climate change were particularly manifested during the 1998 El Niño Southern Oscillation bleaching event that caused widespread hard coral mortality across the WIO region.",

Although no country-wide geographical prioritization of biodiversity has been carried out in Kenya, the high dependence of coastal communities on marine resources, the importance of MPAs for tourism (the mainstay of the Kenyan economy), fisheries and biodiversity and other ecosystem services, and the serious threat of climate change on coral reefs and associated ecosystems increase the urgency for strengthening the management of Kenyan MPAs.",
					"description": "Coastal communities on the Kenyan coast have traditionally had a high dependence on marine resources as a primary source of food and income. The level of pressure on these resources has increased as the population has grown and development has expanded, leading to increased degradation of coral reefs and associated ecosystems. The Kenya government established Marine Parks that are managed as no-take areas, and Marine Reserves that allow for traditional fishing methods. Historically, Kenyan MPAs were designated by the government through the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), usually due to their importance in relation to coastal development, or their attractiveness for tourism purposes.  However, lack of due attention to resident fishing communities and other stakeholders has resulted in resentment and subsequent conflicts between MPA management and stakeholders, as well as the inability of the MPAs to fully meet their conservation and management objectives.  Management planning that involved stakeholders was not undertaken until 2000 while well intentioned, these plans were not sufficiently institutionalized and lacked adequate stakeholder buy-in that is critical to achieving both biodiversity goals and local socioeconomic goals for communities reliant on these MPAs.  <br/><br/>Multiple or cumulative human impacts including the effects of global warming can lessen the long-term resilience of marine ecosystems such as coral reefs and mangroves by altering their capacity to recover and maintain ecosystem function following disturbance. So MPAs are more effective when set within a broader management framework such as Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) and uses holistic approaches such as the Ecosystem approach. Although the new Kenyan Fisheries and Ocean Policy and the new ICZM policy make reference to ecosystem management, experience in the use of these approaches is lacking in Kenya. The implementation of a network of MPAs could achieve an ICM framework. Some of the common challenges encountered in the management of MPAs in Kenya include; <br/>• Ecological representation; Marine biodiversity is under-represented in MPAs and there was little attempt to address their management in terms of unique or endemic species, connectivity between sites, important migratory or charismatic species, or other trans-boundary management issues, the impacts of global climate change (e.g. coral bleaching, mangrove die-off, sea-level rise). <br/>• Loss and degradation of marine habitats; Critical marine ecosystems such as coral reefs, seagrass beds and mangrove forests are threatened with loss of biodiversity due to environmental and anthropogenic causes. Factors including poorly regulated fishing in marine reserves, use of destructive fishing gears, sediment inputs from land, climate change induced coral bleaching and mangrove die-off, coastal erosion from poorly planned coastal developments amongst others decrease the effectiveness of MPAs. <br/>• Systematic assessment and monitoring: Currently some ecological monitoring of coral reefs and some human impacts is carried out by KWS and partners, however, other ecosystems such as seagrass beds and mangroves and charismatic species such as sea turtles and marine mammals receive less attention. <br/>• MPA network: Kenyan MPAs are managed as individual units with little integration across MPAs which limits their ability to implement standard regulations and management interventions, and to share experiences and find common solutions for management challenges. Under the framework of the Nairobi Convention, a National Coral Reef task force (NCRTF) that includes relevant government and stakeholder representatives was establised that could be used as a vehicle to drive the harmonization and integration of the MPAs into a functional national network.<br/>• Outdated MPA management plans; The MPA plans of Kenya were developed in 2000 but the ecological, institutional, political and social environment has changed dramatically in the last 10 years. For example, there are new policies, laws and regulations (especially the Beach management unit regulation, Wildlife Policy, and Fisheries and Ocean policy and ICZM policy) that have the potential to impact MPAs, communities are more knowledgeable about their rights and environmental issues, improvements in governance and the higher pace of development all have implications for the management of MPAs<br/>• Increasing rates of conflicts; Social, economic and political conflicts regularly arise around Kenyan MPAs that undermine and sometimes totally obstruct, management and conservation objectives. The ability to understand and address conflicts as they occur at each stage in the management process needs to be developed for the successful conservation and management of MPAs.<br/>• Inadequate MPA management training and career opportunities; Although some MPA managers have received training in basic protected area management, most lack technical knowledge about MPA governance and adaptive experiential learning limiting their ability to manage MPAs. In addition, the professionalization of MPA management through regional programs such as the WIO Certification of MPA staff (WIO COMPASS) needs to be recognized within KWS and institutionalized as a career development tool.<br/>• Limited involvement of Indigenous communities; The level of community involvement in MPA management is low reducing the potential support by local communities. Recently, due to increased awareness of the benefits of closures, acceptance of MPAs has increased and communities have started showing an interest in community area management (CMA). A number of CMAs are now being piloted on the Kenyan coast.  The institutional framework and formalization of these CMAs inline with current policies including the BMU regulations would have to be resolved to increase community participation in marine conservation.<br/>• Lack of harmonized policies and regulations; There is inadequate institutional, legislative and enforcement capacity within a broader national management framework. While Kenya has numerous environmental laws and policies, most of them are in conflict and lack inter-sector coordination mechanisms. Institutional mandates also overlap and enforcement is weak which limits the effectiveness of management interventions.<br/>• Uncoordinated enforcement and surveillance; Despite relatively robust legal instruments that protect marine biodiversity, enforcement of regulations is weak in the reserves and for species of special concern that occur outside MPAs.  Joint patrols could decrease infringement of regulations but the mechanisms for such patrols needs to be developed.<br/>• Uncoordinated investments and financing; Kenyan MPAs lack adequate funds for development activities including community livelihood initiatives.  This limits the ability of the MPAs to build their own capacity to carry out conservation activities as well as to strengthen existing partnership by the demonstration of tangible benefits.  Few viable institutional, business or enterprise models have emerged around the MPAs’. It is anticipated that this project will provide a harmonized investment strategy that will guide the growth of enterprises in and around the MPA's. <br/>• Lack of coordination at the national level; there are numerous organizations, initiatives and projects working on marine conservation and management related programs in Kenya. The newly formed NCRTF, which is tasked with promoting coordination and harmonizing conservation and management activities for coral reefs, could take on this role since coral reefs are the dominant ecosystem in MPAs. In addition although Kenya has a new ICM policy few organizations are currently using this new approach. <br/><br/>If Kenya is to successfully build an effective network of MPAs and meet its commitments to WSSD 2012 agreement and other biodiversity agreements, there is a need for an overall national strategic approach. This approach needs to improve the current understanding of the status of MPAs, to establish a national mechanism to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of these MPAs, to identify the factors that are preventing the effective management of these MPAs (i.e. barriers) at different stages in the management process and to develop appropriate strategies to address these barriers. <br/>The national strategy should aim to improve the success of existing MPAs, progress the implementation of new MPAs, and identify and address gaps in the management network. The strategy should make best use of existing scientific knowledge and current management practice (e.g. adaptive management to capture bleaching-resistant sites, and to promote resilience), and capitalizes on diverse global experiences. The strategy also needs to build the institutional strength and capacity to plan, legislate, enforce, as well as address barriers and conflicts and to monitor and evaluate management. By demonstrating adaptive management programming based on assessment and evaluation of management effectiveness in the MPAs of Kenya, the present project will contribute to the effective management of natural resource and enhance livelihoods in Kenya. The project will also help to strengthen the structures of the NCRTF and to establish mechanisms for transferring knowledge, lessons learned and best practice approaches to effective and adaptive management throughout the Western Indian Ocean region.",

Les insectes sont très peu connus. Trois espèces de papillons endémiques sont menacées parmi lesquelles le papillon Graphium levasseur (Flambée de Levasseur). Le niveau d’endémisme pour les reptiles terrestres est estimé à 44 %, avec 11 espèces endémiques. Le bois de chauffe qui est la principale source d’énergie domestique aux Comores fournit à lui seul 78 % des besoins énergétiques des ménages. Ainsi, plusieurs essences forestières et endémiques sont actuellement surexploitées et sont en voie de disparition. C’est le cas de  Weinmania comorensis (bois de construction), Khaya comorensis (bois d’oeuvre), Ocotea comorensis (charpente et charbon de bois). Il faut souligner qu’on trouve également dans cette forêt,  de nombreuse  espèces médicinales, aromatiques très prometteuses pour la recherche scientifique, malgré la méconnaissance de la totalité de ces espèces. <br/><br/>Les niches écologiques ou habitats de ces espèces endémiques de faune et de flore, sont essentiellement concentrés dans cette zone forestière. Celle ci nécessite donc d’être balisée et soumise à une réglementation pour permettre le maintient des rôles de ces habitats ainsi que la pérennisation de ces espèces endémiques, en raison des conditions climatiques particulières de la zone, les types de paysages, la présence de sites particuliers et espèces végétale indigènes associés indispensable à la survie des  populations de ces espèces. C’est donc une zone incontournable pour la conservation de la biodiversité d’importance nationale et mondiale, qu’il convient de prendre des mesures d’aménagement urgentes pour renverser la tendance actuelle de déperdition. <br/><br/>Par ailleurs, cette expression d’intérêt, présente de nombreux liens avec le programme de travail sur les aires protégées de la CBD qui a pour objectif de soutenir la création et le maintien d’aires protégées. Ces liens sont facilement lisibles, à travers la plupart des buts et de nombreux  objectifs et activités y afférentes. Ce fut le cas par exemple du but: 1.4 portant amélioration de la planification et la gestion des aires protégées avec cette délimitation physique et zonage prévues, le but 1.5 portant prévention et atténuation des impacts négatifs des principales menaces qui pèsent sur les aires protégées avec l’adoption de l’apiculture améliorée au détriment de la cueillette sauvage du miel,  le but 2.1 portant promotion de l’équité et partage équitable des avantages avec les revenues qui seront issues de la vente du miel, le but 3.3 portant élaboration, application et transfert des technologies adaptées aux aires protégées avec cette activité d’apiculture améliorée, etc.<br/><br/>Cette expression d’intérêt s’adresse à un aspect particulier dans la problématique de création et d’opérationnalisation des aires protégées, pour le cas de la première aire protégée terrestre, notamment la délimitation physique, le zonage et le développement d’une activité porteuses pour les communautés locales. Les autres aspects pour cette même aire protégée (exemple les plans d’action pour la conservation des cibles)  ainsi que les autres types d’aires protégées qui vont constituer le réseau national d’aires protégées,  seront traités à travers différentes opportunités financières, notamment le  GEF5-STAR, le life web CBD/Système d’aires d’protégées, des fonds du programme unique du PNUD (bureau de Moroni), les contributions nationales, etc. Toutefois, il y a lieu  de rassurer  que les résultats spécifiques ciblés avec le financement requis ici s’inscrivent dans le cadre global du processus de création et d’acceptabilité sociale du réseau national d’aires protégées, notamment pour le cas de la première protégée terrestre aux Comores.",

Cette activité s’inscrit dans la visée de la Stratégie Nationale sur la Biodiversité, notamment une des mesures pertinentes prévues et portant  sur l’identification  et la promotion des activités de substitution génératrices de revenus qui en font du développement des activités alternatives, une mesure essentielle pour l’acceptabilité sociale des aires protégées.",
					"description": "La zone forestière du Karthala, est la plus grande forêt naturelle des Comores, par sa superficie ainsi que sa richesse en biodiversité d’importance mondiale par la diversité des espèces endémiques; notamment  des plantes, oiseaux, papillons, et reptiles. Cette zone est soumise à une pression anthropique importante et multiforme liée aux activités jugées indispensables pour satisfaire les besoins fondamentaux d’une part importante de la population.  Elle est retenue comme étant une zone prioritaire de développement durable et de création de la première aire protégée terrestre aux Comores (cf. étude écologique de la forêt du Karthala). <br/><br/>Pour renverser la tendance actuelle de surexploitation, un important travail de base a été réalisé  par le projet « OCB » financé par le PNUD et le programme des Volontaires des Nations Unies. Ce travail a été axé sur :  (i) le développement des capacités des organisations communautaires de base des villages riverains à travers la mise en œuvre d’un plan de formation spécifique destiné à toutes les communautés locales des zones prioritaires de conservation de la biodiversité à l’échelle nationale, y compris les villages de la zone de la forêt du Karthala;  permettant une meilleure compréhension des enjeux liés à la gestion des ressources biotiques,  (ii) l’organisation des communautés locales par : la mise en place d’un Comité local d’orientation de développement durable au niveau de chaque village, un Comité de développement durable pour toute la zone (CODD), l’élaboration d’un plan de développement durable au niveau de chaque village, (iii) une cartographie participative illustrant les modes d’exploitation de la zone, (iv) une étude écologique qui a permis de déboucher à une proposition de délimitation et de zonage du site en aire protégée, (v) une étude d’impact socio économique et biophysique qui permet d’orienter les activités dans cette zone (cf. rapports), (vi) des accords de cogestion en cours de validation  entre chaque village et la direction de l’environnement, (vii) un projet de décret présidentiel encours d’élaboration pour soumission par les communautés locales avec l’appui du Ministère en charge de l’environnement. <br/><br/>Malgré tous ces efforts, le processus de création de l’aire protégée en question se trouve confronté à plusieurs problèmes financiers et techniques  parmi lesquels  (i) la matérialisation de la délimitation physique et le zonage de l’aire protégée  en vue d’inciter objectivement des aménagement internes, (ii) l’acceptabilité sociale par les groupes les plus vulnérables en l’absence d’activités de substruction et génératrice de revenue en vue d’une adoption effective de la nouvelle réglementation. <br/><br/>Ainsi, ce projet va permettre de matérialiser la délimitation physique et le zonage  ainsi que le développement de la filière apicole au profit des communautés locales en tant que source de complément d’aliment et de création de revenu non négligeables.",

		"summary": "Social marketing training and campaigns will be implemented at 12 sites in Indonesia, through the government agencies responsible for management of priority marine protected areas.   Each campaign will target a local population of about 20,000 people, and aim to change the behaviour of the fishing communities such that they understand the importance of no-take zones, respect them and support their enforcement.  This will result in recovery of local fisheries and marine biodiversity and improve the management of about four million hectares of protected areas in Indonesia.  Capacity of the local partners will be greatly strengthened so that they can sustain the campaigns and their impacts beyond the initial project.",
		"description": "The complete Coral Triangle includes Eastern Indonesia, East Timor, the Philippines, part of Malaysia (around Borneo), Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Marine habitats and species are severely threatened by over-exploitation especially in the Western part of this region. <br/>The most important threats in the Coral Triangle reefs and fisheries are over-fishing, destructive fishing and poaching of vulnerable species. Fisheries reform is essential for the success of marine conservation and Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).  Substantial and strict No-Take Zones (NTZs) need to be included in the toolbox for fisheries management. The role of MPAs as the most effective strategy to conserve coral reefs and their ecosystem services has become widely accepted among scientists, as well as in governments and NGOs, and a wide array of efforts involving their planning and financing is underway. Local threats from over-fishing and destructive practices can be effectively addressed in MPAs that guarantee against the collapse of fish stocks and can serve as sources of fish for surrounding fishing grounds. Development of local public support for MPAs and NTZs, is by far the most urgently needed site conservation strategy in the Coral Triangle.<br/>The 12 campaigns in this project aim to fill a key gap in the struggle to conserve diverse marine ecosystems by achieving the implementation of large no-take zones and rights-based fisheries in some of the world’s most important MPAs in the Coral Triangle.  Social marketing campaigns will be used to build understanding and support for no-take zones and local rights-based fisheries management that will enhance local livelihoods from fisheries, add new economic opportunities such as from the fees generated by scuba and tourism, and improve biodiversity conservation.  Partnerships between local communities, NGOs and government agencies will be strengthened together with potential for attracting additional conservation funding for the sites. <br/><br/>This project directly supports the goals, plans and programs of the Ministry of Forestry and of the Ministry of Marine Affairs & Fisheries (MMAF) and commitments under the Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) and the Sulu-Sulawesi Marine Eco-region (SSME). Rare, an international conservation NGO, will serve as the lead strategic implementing partner. The two Ministries believe that by working together with Rare in designing and implementing social marketing conservation campaigns, the management of marine protected areas in the Indonesia, would be enhanced and hence, would contribute in furthering our country’s implementation of the CBD’s Program of Work on Protected Areas, CTI and SSME. Supporting Rare in their work will also help local communities, governments and Non -Government Organizations (NGOs) in building/enhancing the capacity of local leaders and their constituents in recognizing, validating and contributing their share towards sustained protection of the country’s marine ecosystem.<br/><br/>This proposal focuses on Indonesia and campaigns in this project will improve the management of about 4 million hectares of priority MPAs in Indonesia’s portion of the Coral Triangle.",

Defined as containing 500 or more species of reef-building coral anywhere within its boundaries, over 75 percent of all known coral species can be found here, as well as over 3,000 species of fish and an unequaled variety of invertebrates. The Coral Triangle is a major center of tropical marine evolution, containing more than half of the world’s coral reefs as well as the greatest extent of mangrove forests globally. All major international biodiversity conservation organizations have identified the Coral Triangle as a global priority area for marine conservation.<br/>The Coral Triangle is also home to the greatest extent of mangrove forests globally.  <br/>Resources within the Coral Triangle directly sustain more than 120 million people. The reefs in this region have an economic output estimated at US$2.3 billion annually.  Coral reefs and associated habitats such as mangroves and sea-grass beds support small scale community fisheries along tens of thousands of kilometers of coastline. The loss of ecosystem goods and services provided by Coral Triangle reefs would have tremendous impacts on local livelihoods and wellbeing.<br/><br/>Indonesia’s Head of State has stressed the importance of improving the management of MPAs within the Coral Triangle, and jointly hosted a meeting of Heads of State from the region, leading to the Manado Declaration and regional and national action plans.  This project directly contributes to the implementation of Indonesia’s national action plan, and complements the ongoing work under regional GEF and USAID-funded initiatives.<br/><br/>All of the sites that are candidates for campaign implementation in this proposal are key parts of Indonesia’s national network of over 150 MPAs.",

Fishers representatives will sit on advisory councils, and contribute more actively to the elaboration and implementation of management plans.   The Program will directly help to contribute poverty reduction and accomplish the Millennium Goals. <br/><br/>While gender is not an explicit criterion for site or partner selection, it is very much factored into the proposed campaign approach. The surveys and community outreach engage women (and children) very actively.  Campaign design includes women as key parts of the target audience segmentation. <br/><br/>Effective MPA management has a major impact on food security, which greatly affects women in their role as providers of food for the family and often as vendors of fish and seafood, as well as supporting food sources for the most marginalized fishers. This project recognizes important differences in how women and men use, manage, and conserve biological resources. Campaign planning integrates the understanding of gender-based differences and their implications for natural resources management and biodiversity conservation into conservation programs and policies. By giving women a clear role in biodiversity decision-making, the social acceptability and sustainability of MPA conservation and management efforts can be enhanced. Involving women is often the most effective avenue for generating behavioral change. Women and children are often the ones found gleaning in the buffer zones of the NTZs that are dependent on the near-shore coral reef and seagrass habitats, while men are commonly associated with being the ones out in the deeper sea fishing for the migratory small and large pelagic fish.<br/><br/>The basic strategy for this program is also partly based on the traditional approaches of sasi or closure of fishing grounds used in Eastern Indonesia today and in practice for many generations.",

Each campaign will target a local population of about 20,000 people, and aim to change the behaviour of the fishing communities such that they understand the importance of no-take zones, respect them and support their enforcement.

Capacity of the local partners will be greatly strengthened so that they can sustain the campaigns and their impacts beyond the initial project.",
					"description": "The complete Coral Triangle includes Eastern Indonesia, East Timor, the Philippines, part of Malaysia (around Borneo), Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Marine habitats and species are severely threatened by over-exploitation especially in the Western part of this region. <br/>The most important threats in the Coral Triangle reefs and fisheries are over-fishing, destructive fishing and poaching of vulnerable species. Fisheries reform is essential for the success of marine conservation and Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).  Substantial and strict No-Take Zones (NTZs) need to be included in the toolbox for fisheries management. The role of MPAs as the most effective strategy to conserve coral reefs and their ecosystem services has become widely accepted among scientists, as well as in governments and NGOs, and a wide array of efforts involving their planning and financing is underway. Local threats from over-fishing and destructive practices can be effectively addressed in MPAs that guarantee against the collapse of fish stocks and can serve as sources of fish for surrounding fishing grounds. Development of local public support for MPAs and NTZs, is by far the most urgently needed site conservation strategy in the Coral Triangle.<br/>The 12 campaigns in this project aim to fill a key gap in the struggle to conserve diverse marine ecosystems by achieving the implementation of large no-take zones and rights-based fisheries in some of the world’s most important MPAs in the Coral Triangle.  Social marketing campaigns will be used to build understanding and support for no-take zones and local rights-based fisheries management that will enhance local livelihoods from fisheries, add new economic opportunities such as from the fees generated by scuba and tourism, and improve biodiversity conservation.  Partnerships between local communities, NGOs and government agencies will be strengthened together with potential for attracting additional conservation funding for the sites. <br/><br/>This project directly supports the goals, plans and programs of the Ministry of Forestry and of the Ministry of Marine Affairs & Fisheries (MMAF) and commitments under the Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) and the Sulu-Sulawesi Marine Eco-region (SSME). Rare, an international conservation NGO, will serve as the lead strategic implementing partner. The two Ministries believe that by working together with Rare in designing and implementing social marketing conservation campaigns, the management of marine protected areas in the Indonesia, would be enhanced and hence, would contribute in furthering our country’s implementation of the CBD’s Program of Work on Protected Areas, CTI and SSME. Supporting Rare in their work will also help local communities, governments and Non -Government Organizations (NGOs) in building/enhancing the capacity of local leaders and their constituents in recognizing, validating and contributing their share towards sustained protection of the country’s marine ecosystem.<br/><br/>This proposal focuses on Indonesia and campaigns in this project will improve the management of about 4 million hectares of priority MPAs in Indonesia’s portion of the Coral Triangle.",

		"summary": "The SPAN project is a national level project aimed at improving the management effectiveness and financial sustainability of Mongolia’s existing protected areas system. Currently, there are 74 protected areas in Mongolia covering a total of over 22 million hectares, which equates to approximately 14% of the country’s surface. Mongolia’s 74 protected areas include Strictly Protected Areas, National Parks, Nature Reserves and National Monuments, covering IUCN categories Ia, Ib, II and III.",
		"description": "Being the most sparsely populated country in the world and characterised by a nomadic lifestyle with a traditional respect for nature, Mongolia has been able to preserve a lot of valuable biodiversity that has disappeared elsewhere in the region. <br/><br/>Mongolia hosts globally-significant populations of a number of critically endangered species, such as the Mongolian Saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica mongolica; 100% of global population), the Gobi bear (Ursus arctos gobiensis; 100%), the Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus; approximately 37%) and the re-introduced Przewalski's horse (Equus ferus przewalskii; 95%), as well as globally endangered species like the snow leopard (Uncia uncial; approximately 12%), the long-eared jerboa (Euchoreutes naso) and the Mongolian three-toed jerboa (Stylodipus sungorus).<br/><br/>In the past 20 years, many species have sharply declined, facing increasing threats from poaching, mining, habitat fragmentation, overfishing and habitat loss. After the country embarked on a transition from its former socialist system to a more open market oriented model, the mining sector experienced a boom and the number of livestock grew dramatically. This has lead to severe damage of ecosystems while new infrastructure development further fragments the open steppe landscape.<br/> <br/>The Government has rapidly expanded its protected area system to counter these losses. Since the 1990s, the area of Mongolia designated as protected area grew from less than 10 to the current total of 74 protected areas, which now cover over 25 million hectares, 16% of the country’s surface. Capacities and resources for protected area management have not kept pace with the expansion of the protected area network, resulting in a situation where most protected areas in Mongolia suffer from inadequate resources to conserve important species and habitats. <br/><br/>Of Mongolia’s 74 protected areas, there are:<br/>(1) 14 Strictly Protected Areas (IUCN categories Ia and Ib) covering an area of 11,887,758 ha<br/>(2) 26 National Parks (IUCN category II) covering an area of 11,418,886 ha<br/>(3) 24 Nature Reserves (IUCN category III) covering an area of 2,239,616ha<br/>(4) 10 National Monuments (IUCN category III) covering an area of 116,567 ha.<br/><br/>Mongolia’s Law on Buffer Zones requires the establishment of Buffer Zones outside Protected Areas and also allows for their establishment either outside or overlapping with the Limited Use Zone of National Parks. In addition, local government may establish Buffer Zones around Nature Reserves and Natural Monuments.<br/><br/>In addition to Mongolia’s national protected area system, there is a local protected area system. Mongolia’s Law on Special Protected Areas empowers Governments at the provincial and local level to designate local protected areas. To date, approximately 937 local protected areas have been established in Mongolia, covering over 16.5 million ha (equivalent to over 10% of the country); however, few (if any) receive financial or human resources necessary to achieve their conservation objectives. These local protected areas are not considered to be part of the Mongolian national protected area system.<br/><br/>As part of its commitment to the Convention on Biodiversity, the Government of Mongolia set a formal target to conserve 30% of the country (46.9 million ha) in protected areas by 2030.<br/><br/>The key challenges for management of the existing protected area system are:<br/><br/>(1) The current legal framework and guidelines on Protected Area management planning and decision making systems do not enable the protected area management at the national and local level to generate sufficient resources to address biodiversity threats. <br/><br/>(2) Operational and capacity weaknesses prevent cost-effective protected area management. The capacity building needs of protected area staff to perform protected area functions are not systematically assessed and there are neither long term capacity building plans nor adequate allocation of resources for such activities. This leads to ineffective use of existing protected area resources – both human and financial - to achieve meaningful biodiversity conservation impacts.<br/><br/>There is also a lack of comprehensive budget plans and business plans for revenue generation and therefore protected areas are under-resourced to protect biodiversity and are not equipped to develop new funding sources.",

For example, over the last decades, autumn and winter precipitation has increased by almost 9%, while spring and summer precipitation has decreased by almost 10%. The permafrost zone of Lake Khovsgol National Park in northern Mongolia, where the annual air temperature has increased by 1.44°C since 1963, is showing signs of rapid change. Extended droughts that are likely to be related to climate change have caused the drying-up of an estimated 500 rivers and lakes, including those in protected areas. These changes undermine ecosystem resilience and the highly vulnerable biodiversity in Mongolia. This is particularly critical for globally threatened species that live in the most marginal areas, such as the Gobi Desert and Altai Mountains.<br/><br/>Mongolia’s National Climate Change report states that 78.2% of land in Mongolia affected somehow by desertification and land degradation. Various reports estimate that majority of grasslands, including protected areas, is degraded to some extent. With the exception of Strictly protected areas, livestock grazing is allowed within Protected areas. PAs include land that has traditionally been used by herder families. These areas are important for the animal husbandry industry, a key economic resource, which directly depends on the vegetation and climate conditions. In some areas, rangeland conditions within last several years have deteriorated rapidly because of extreme weather events (drought and blizzards), an increasing livestock population and a greater concentration of people. However, the project will largely deal with local communities, local authorities and the Protected Area Administration to re-introduce seasonal grazing in line with new innovative management practices to respond and adapt to these changes.  <br/><br/>An important activity that the project intends to carry out with additional funding is to integrate climate change adaptation into protected area management guidelines. The project would start by reviewing the management plants of the 3 target sites and revise their management plans to integrate climate change adaptation considerations. "

Currently, there are 74 protected areas in Mongolia covering a total of over 22 million hectares, which equates to approximately 14% of the country’s surface.

					"description": "Being the most sparsely populated country in the world and characterised by a nomadic lifestyle with a traditional respect for nature, Mongolia has been able to preserve a lot of valuable biodiversity that has disappeared elsewhere in the region. <br/><br/>Mongolia hosts globally-significant populations of a number of critically endangered species, such as the Mongolian Saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica mongolica; 100% of global population), the Gobi bear (Ursus arctos gobiensis; 100%), the Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus; approximately 37%) and the re-introduced Przewalski's horse (Equus ferus przewalskii; 95%), as well as globally endangered species like the snow leopard (Uncia uncial; approximately 12%), the long-eared jerboa (Euchoreutes naso) and the Mongolian three-toed jerboa (Stylodipus sungorus).<br/><br/>In the past 20 years, many species have sharply declined, facing increasing threats from poaching, mining, habitat fragmentation, overfishing and habitat loss. After the country embarked on a transition from its former socialist system to a more open market oriented model, the mining sector experienced a boom and the number of livestock grew dramatically. This has lead to severe damage of ecosystems while new infrastructure development further fragments the open steppe landscape.<br/> <br/>The Government has rapidly expanded its protected area system to counter these losses. Since the 1990s, the area of Mongolia designated as protected area grew from less than 10 to the current total of 74 protected areas, which now cover over 25 million hectares, 16% of the country’s surface. Capacities and resources for protected area management have not kept pace with the expansion of the protected area network, resulting in a situation where most protected areas in Mongolia suffer from inadequate resources to conserve important species and habitats. <br/><br/>Of Mongolia’s 74 protected areas, there are:<br/>(1) 14 Strictly Protected Areas (IUCN categories Ia and Ib) covering an area of 11,887,758 ha<br/>(2) 26 National Parks (IUCN category II) covering an area of 11,418,886 ha<br/>(3) 24 Nature Reserves (IUCN category III) covering an area of 2,239,616ha<br/>(4) 10 National Monuments (IUCN category III) covering an area of 116,567 ha.<br/><br/>Mongolia’s Law on Buffer Zones requires the establishment of Buffer Zones outside Protected Areas and also allows for their establishment either outside or overlapping with the Limited Use Zone of National Parks. In addition, local government may establish Buffer Zones around Nature Reserves and Natural Monuments.<br/><br/>In addition to Mongolia’s national protected area system, there is a local protected area system. Mongolia’s Law on Special Protected Areas empowers Governments at the provincial and local level to designate local protected areas. To date, approximately 937 local protected areas have been established in Mongolia, covering over 16.5 million ha (equivalent to over 10% of the country); however, few (if any) receive financial or human resources necessary to achieve their conservation objectives. These local protected areas are not considered to be part of the Mongolian national protected area system.<br/><br/>As part of its commitment to the Convention on Biodiversity, the Government of Mongolia set a formal target to conserve 30% of the country (46.9 million ha) in protected areas by 2030.<br/><br/>The key challenges for management of the existing protected area system are:<br/><br/>(1) The current legal framework and guidelines on Protected Area management planning and decision making systems do not enable the protected area management at the national and local level to generate sufficient resources to address biodiversity threats. <br/><br/>(2) Operational and capacity weaknesses prevent cost-effective protected area management. The capacity building needs of protected area staff to perform protected area functions are not systematically assessed and there are neither long term capacity building plans nor adequate allocation of resources for such activities. This leads to ineffective use of existing protected area resources – both human and financial - to achieve meaningful biodiversity conservation impacts.<br/><br/>There is also a lack of comprehensive budget plans and business plans for revenue generation and therefore protected areas are under-resourced to protect biodiversity and are not equipped to develop new funding sources.",

		"description": "Burkina Faso is a Sahelian and Landlocked country, located in Western Africa in the Niger belt and at the border of the Sahara. The country covers an area of 273.187 sq km, bordering Mali in the North and West, Ivory Cost, Ghana, Togo and Benin in the South, and Niger in the East. Although the country does not have direct access to sea, it is deeply streamed in the Regional space, its territory being shared between the hydro graphic landscapes of Comoé, Niger, Nakambé and Mouhoun. <br/><br/>In terms of economy, the population well-being indicators are below the average vales of Africa. The Human Development Indicator is estimated at 0.342 (UNDP 2006) and the net income per capita is $400 dollars. It is ranked as a Least Developed Country.<br/><br/>In terms of  agro-climate, there are two (02) domains and four (04) sectors:<br/>The Sudanian domain includes:<br/>- The South Sudanian sector characterized by an average annual rainfall more than 900 mm. It is the most humid zone of the country, covering 36% of the total area and having 20 inhabitants per sq Km. It is also considered to be the destination area of migrants, mainly the Mossi and Fulani coming from the Northern part of the country. In these areas, the environment is threatened by the migration pressure and the extensive production systems;<br/>- The North Sudanian sector covering 33.7% of the total area with an annual rainfall varying from 750 to 900 mm. It represents 32% of the potential crop land with  50% of the population;<br/><br/>The Sahelian domain includes:<br/>- The strict Sahelian sector in the extreme North of the country characterized by an annual rainfall varying from 400 to 600 mm. It covers 11% of the country area. The population density is estimated at 5 inhabitants per sq km. It is mainly a pastoral zone;<br/>- The sub sahelian sector located between the North Sudanian and the Strict Sahelian sectors; its rainfall varies from 600 to 750 mm. The population density is estimated at 36 to 50 inhabitants per sq km, .corresponding to 19% of the total population. <br/><br/>Aware of the importance of the biodiversity conservation, the country ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in September 1993 and has set necessary instruments facilitating its implementation. Burkina Faso confirmed its perception of the importance of PAs as strategic areas for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity through its commitment to the Programme of Work on Protected Areas (PoWPA). This programme, hence, strengthens the country’s capacity in implementing its Strategy and Actions Plan on biodiversity. In addition the Project is in harmony with the general principles on decentralization, in particular the decentralization law N° 055-2004/AN of 2004 of December 24 adopted General Code of Territorial Collectivities in Burkina Faso, which sanctions the right of the territorial collectivities (areas and communes) to manage and manage freely their own businesses, in particular those linked to natural resources. <br/><br/>Despite the important efforts initiated with the support of its technical and financial partners, the civil society, the private and research sectors, the country is still facing a rapid population growth (2,4% per year), the current population (2006) being estimated at more than 13 millions  increasing pressure on land and related resources. The economy is mainly based on the exploitation of natural resources (agriculture, livestock, mining, traditional energy, etc.). This, in turn generated high pressure on these resources, which added to the climatic change cause an increasing erosion of the natural capital. Burkina Faso is facing important threats including land degradation, vegetation and forests degradation, climate change, reduction of the biodiversity capital and the accelerated development of urban environmental problems. The protected areas (PA) represent more than 16% of the territory, and constitute the biodiversity concentration areas in terms of species (fauna and flora) as well as ecosystems. The national PA system is a network of parks, total and partial reserves, gazetted forests and community reserves. The wildlife is composed of more than 128 mammalian species including more than 477 bird species and 60 reptiles and amphibians. Including, some emblematic ones such as Elephant (Loxodonta africana), lion (Panthera leo), buffalo (Syncerus caffer brachyceros) and roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus) are well represented. Forest land covers more than 16.620.000 Ha, including 880.000 Ha represent gazetted forests   (Parkan, 1986) which contribution to the GDP is estimated at 1%.<br/><br/>The threats and constraints to PA management system were identified and described in the PCGRFF and the CPP Documents. They are summarized in this section with reference to the results of the initial analysis PoWPA. There are three categories:<br/><br/>Threat 1: Agricultural encroachments <br/>More of 80% of the population of Burkina Faso lives on agriculture. The majority of PAs are located in the most agricultural endowed zones (East, South, South-West and West), and consequently are facing high pressure of agricultural land demand. The introduction of cash crops such as cotton using large areas has contributed to increase this deficit of cropland. The consequence is permanent risks of forests clearing for agriculture in the vicinity and more often within the PAs.<br/><br/>Farmers are still using extensive production systems and fire clearing while pastoralism remains the major livestock traditional production system. These production systems bring about erosion and land degradation around the PAs, hence increasing the vulnerability of the giving ecosystems. <br/><br/>Threat 2: Fragmentation of ecosystems by illegal and/or non rational exploitation, even excessive exploitation of natural resources <br/><br/>(Siltation) silting and pollutions of water resources:<br/>We noticed the utilization of more and more chemical products in some crops production (cotton and legumes) and non rational exploitation of lowlands and rivers during the dry season. These practices induce siltation and pollutions of water resources considered as the central points of the ecosystems balance in the PAs. <br/><br/>Transhumance and settlements:<br/>The migration of population to the vicinity of PAs is associated with important move of flocks and herds through transhumance or settlements. The majority of PAs are also located at borders of the country. Hence, they are continuously facing the consequences of transnational transhumance. This co-existence represents an important threat to PAS (disturbance of wildlife, competition over the use of feed resources, risks of zoonosis contamination, risks of poisoning of wild carnivores by herders, poaching, etc.).<br/><br/>Poaching:<br/>Poaching is still an important threat as favored by low operational capacity of the institutions in charge of PA management and also by the low income and limited alternatives among surrounding populations. Other factors like the easy availability of firearms, the development of numerous channels for the marketing of hunting products (bushmeat, wildlife by-products), and the high level of demand for bushmeat are also contributing. As a consequence, several species are threatened or disappeared.<br/><br/>Over exploitation of forest products: <br/>The excessive wood cutting continues to threaten severely the biodiversity of the PAs. The forest products concerned are wood, charcoal, and non timber products (fruits, leaves, roots, etc.) used for human, livestock feeding and handcraft. Several endemic species of the PAs are threatened by these exploitations. <br/><br/>The uncontrolled bush fires:<br/>Despite the efforts made by government to sensitize and raise awareness of all the population since 1980’, uncontrolled bush fires are still reported. Most of them occur towards the end of the dry season when vegetation is too dry.

They are known as village forests, sacred forests, ZOVIC, sanctuaries, refuges, etc. These areas are part of village or communes territories not totally identified nor gazetted. <br/><br/>In response to the insufficiency of financial resources to conduct an appropriate management of PAs, Burkina Faso has initiated an important political and legal reform which improved the involvement of private sector and local communities around the PAs. Twelve Unities of Wildlife Conservation (UCF) were identified in 1996  and a forestry code adopted in 1997. The forestry code defines the conditions of access and gives the legal background for the participation of private sector to PAs management contracts (Concessions). These UCF evolved recently into Unities of Protection and Conservation of Wildlife (UPC). Each UPC comprises one or several linked PAs. As such UPC are monitored and managed by a Conservator appointed by the government. However the effective management and commercial exploitation of the PAs are contracted to private companies (Concessionaries) which in return share the earnings with the government and local communities. <br/><br/>These reforms stress also the effective participation of all categories of stakeholders, specifically private sector and local communities based on the principles of equity and accountability regarding benefits sharing. In 2006, Burkina Faso has drafted a new programme (PCGDRFF) to more put the stress on practical orientations for the development of partnership “Government-Local communities-private sector”. <br/><br/>In 2008, a National Office for PAs was created (OFINAP). It is a public company set to contribute to ensure an effective management of the NPAS. The specific mandate of the OFINAP is to contribute to the implementation of the orientations from the National Forest Policy as stated in the PCGDRF.

					"description": "Burkina Faso is a Sahelian and Landlocked country, located in Western Africa in the Niger belt and at the border of the Sahara. The country covers an area of 273.187 sq km, bordering Mali in the North and West, Ivory Cost, Ghana, Togo and Benin in the South, and Niger in the East. Although the country does not have direct access to sea, it is deeply streamed in the Regional space, its territory being shared between the hydro graphic landscapes of Comoé, Niger, Nakambé and Mouhoun. <br/><br/>In terms of economy, the population well-being indicators are below the average vales of Africa. The Human Development Indicator is estimated at 0.342 (UNDP 2006) and the net income per capita is $400 dollars. It is ranked as a Least Developed Country.<br/><br/>In terms of  agro-climate, there are two (02) domains and four (04) sectors:<br/>The Sudanian domain includes:<br/>- The South Sudanian sector characterized by an average annual rainfall more than 900 mm. It is the most humid zone of the country, covering 36% of the total area and having 20 inhabitants per sq Km. It is also considered to be the destination area of migrants, mainly the Mossi and Fulani coming from the Northern part of the country. In these areas, the environment is threatened by the migration pressure and the extensive production systems;<br/>- The North Sudanian sector covering 33.7% of the total area with an annual rainfall varying from 750 to 900 mm. It represents 32% of the potential crop land with  50% of the population;<br/><br/>The Sahelian domain includes:<br/>- The strict Sahelian sector in the extreme North of the country characterized by an annual rainfall varying from 400 to 600 mm. It covers 11% of the country area. The population density is estimated at 5 inhabitants per sq km. It is mainly a pastoral zone;<br/>- The sub sahelian sector located between the North Sudanian and the Strict Sahelian sectors; its rainfall varies from 600 to 750 mm. The population density is estimated at 36 to 50 inhabitants per sq km, .corresponding to 19% of the total population. <br/><br/>Aware of the importance of the biodiversity conservation, the country ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in September 1993 and has set necessary instruments facilitating its implementation. Burkina Faso confirmed its perception of the importance of PAs as strategic areas for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity through its commitment to the Programme of Work on Protected Areas (PoWPA). This programme, hence, strengthens the country’s capacity in implementing its Strategy and Actions Plan on biodiversity. In addition the Project is in harmony with the general principles on decentralization, in particular the decentralization law N° 055-2004/AN of 2004 of December 24 adopted General Code of Territorial Collectivities in Burkina Faso, which sanctions the right of the territorial collectivities (areas and communes) to manage and manage freely their own businesses, in particular those linked to natural resources. <br/><br/>Despite the important efforts initiated with the support of its technical and financial partners, the civil society, the private and research sectors, the country is still facing a rapid population growth (2,4% per year), the current population (2006) being estimated at more than 13 millions  increasing pressure on land and related resources. The economy is mainly based on the exploitation of natural resources (agriculture, livestock, mining, traditional energy, etc.). This, in turn generated high pressure on these resources, which added to the climatic change cause an increasing erosion of the natural capital. Burkina Faso is facing important threats including land degradation, vegetation and forests degradation, climate change, reduction of the biodiversity capital and the accelerated development of urban environmental problems. The protected areas (PA) represent more than 16% of the territory, and constitute the biodiversity concentration areas in terms of species (fauna and flora) as well as ecosystems. The national PA system is a network of parks, total and partial reserves, gazetted forests and community reserves. The wildlife is composed of more than 128 mammalian species including more than 477 bird species and 60 reptiles and amphibians. Including, some emblematic ones such as Elephant (Loxodonta africana), lion (Panthera leo), buffalo (Syncerus caffer brachyceros) and roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus) are well represented. Forest land covers more than 16.620.000 Ha, including 880.000 Ha represent gazetted forests   (Parkan, 1986) which contribution to the GDP is estimated at 1%.<br/><br/>The threats and constraints to PA management system were identified and described in the PCGRFF and the CPP Documents. They are summarized in this section with reference to the results of the initial analysis PoWPA. There are three categories:<br/><br/>Threat 1: Agricultural encroachments <br/>More of 80% of the population of Burkina Faso lives on agriculture. The majority of PAs are located in the most agricultural endowed zones (East, South, South-West and West), and consequently are facing high pressure of agricultural land demand. The introduction of cash crops such as cotton using large areas has contributed to increase this deficit of cropland. The consequence is permanent risks of forests clearing for agriculture in the vicinity and more often within the PAs.<br/><br/>Farmers are still using extensive production systems and fire clearing while pastoralism remains the major livestock traditional production system. These production systems bring about erosion and land degradation around the PAs, hence increasing the vulnerability of the giving ecosystems. <br/><br/>Threat 2: Fragmentation of ecosystems by illegal and/or non rational exploitation, even excessive exploitation of natural resources <br/><br/>(Siltation) silting and pollutions of water resources:<br/>We noticed the utilization of more and more chemical products in some crops production (cotton and legumes) and non rational exploitation of lowlands and rivers during the dry season. These practices induce siltation and pollutions of water resources considered as the central points of the ecosystems balance in the PAs. <br/><br/>Transhumance and settlements:<br/>The migration of population to the vicinity of PAs is associated with important move of flocks and herds through transhumance or settlements. The majority of PAs are also located at borders of the country. Hence, they are continuously facing the consequences of transnational transhumance. This co-existence represents an important threat to PAS (disturbance of wildlife, competition over the use of feed resources, risks of zoonosis contamination, risks of poisoning of wild carnivores by herders, poaching, etc.).<br/><br/>Poaching:<br/>Poaching is still an important threat as favored by low operational capacity of the institutions in charge of PA management and also by the low income and limited alternatives among surrounding populations. Other factors like the easy availability of firearms, the development of numerous channels for the marketing of hunting products (bushmeat, wildlife by-products), and the high level of demand for bushmeat are also contributing. As a consequence, several species are threatened or disappeared.<br/><br/>Over exploitation of forest products: <br/>The excessive wood cutting continues to threaten severely the biodiversity of the PAs. The forest products concerned are wood, charcoal, and non timber products (fruits, leaves, roots, etc.) used for human, livestock feeding and handcraft. Several endemic species of the PAs are threatened by these exploitations. <br/><br/>The uncontrolled bush fires:<br/>Despite the efforts made by government to sensitize and raise awareness of all the population since 1980’, uncontrolled bush fires are still reported. Most of them occur towards the end of the dry season when vegetation is too dry. These types of fires have severe consequences of the capacity of resilience of biotopes and species and contribute to the destruction of a major part of small wildlife and micro fauna. <br/><br/>Threat 3: Acceleration of the degradation of the climate conditions  <br/>The climate change and variability add up to the consequences of unsustainable practices related to natural resources exploitation by local communities. The recurrent droughts, flooding decreasing rainfall and increasing temperature are threatening the populations’ livelihoods, species and ecosystems.<br/> <br/>The support of LifeWeb Initiative is expected to contribute to a deep analysis of the national PA system in order to improve its participatory management, a political option set by the government for the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. The priority activities identified by stakeholders for this application are 3.1.2, 3.1.1, 1.1.4, 4.1.2, 2.1.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4. It is expected that their effective implementation will contribute significantly to the management of forest and wild life resources as stated in the National Framework Programme (PCGDRFF, 2006-2015), and also the Institutional and legislative reform for the decentralized management of Natural resources (PRIJD-SF, 2006).",

The national PA system is a network of parks, total and partial reserves, gazetted forests and community reserves. The wildlife is composed of more than 128 mammalian species including more than 477 bird species and 60 reptiles and amphibians. Including, some emblematic ones such as Elephant (Loxodonta africana), lion (Panthera leo), buffalo (Syncerus caffer brachyceros) and roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus) are well represented. Forest land covers more than 16.620.000 Ha, including 880.000 Ha represent gazetted forests   (Parkan, 1986) which contribution to the GDP is estimated at 1%.<br/><br/>The threats and constraints to PA management system were identified and described in the PCGRFF and the CPP Documents. They are summarized in this section with reference to the results of the initial analysis PoWPA. There are three categories:<br/><br/>Threat 1: Agricultural encroachments <br/>More of 80% of the population of Burkina Faso lives on agriculture. The majority of PAs are located in the most agricultural endowed zones (East, South, South-West and West), and consequently are facing high pressure of agricultural land demand. The introduction of cash crops such as cotton using large areas has contributed to increase this deficit of cropland. The consequence is permanent risks of forests clearing for agriculture in the vicinity and more often within the PAs.<br/><br/>Farmers are still using extensive production systems and fire clearing while pastoralism remains the major livestock traditional production system. These production systems bring about erosion and land degradation around the PAs, hence increasing the vulnerability of the giving ecosystems. <br/><br/>Threat 2: Fragmentation of ecosystems by illegal and/or non rational exploitation, even excessive exploitation of natural resources <br/><br/>(Siltation) silting and pollutions of water resources:<br/>We noticed the utilization of more and more chemical products in some crops production (cotton and legumes) and non rational exploitation of lowlands and rivers during the dry season. These practices induce siltation and pollutions of water resources considered as the central points of the ecosystems balance in the PAs. <br/><br/>Transhumance and settlements:<br/>The migration of population to the vicinity of PAs is associated with important move of flocks and herds through transhumance or settlements. The majority of PAs are also located at borders of the country. Hence, they are continuously facing the consequences of transnational transhumance. This co-existence represents an important threat to PAS (disturbance of wildlife, competition over the use of feed resources, risks of zoonosis contamination, risks of poisoning of wild carnivores by herders, poaching, etc.).<br/><br/>Poaching:<br/>Poaching is still an important threat as favored by low operational capacity of the institutions in charge of PA management and also by the low income and limited alternatives among surrounding populations. Other factors like the easy availability of firearms, the development of numerous channels for the marketing of hunting products (bushmeat, wildlife by-products), and the high level of demand for bushmeat are also contributing. As a consequence, several species are threatened or disappeared.<br/><br/>Over exploitation of forest products: <br/>The excessive wood cutting continues to threaten severely the biodiversity of the PAs. The forest products concerned are wood, charcoal, and non timber products (fruits, leaves, roots, etc.) used for human, livestock feeding and handcraft. Several endemic species of the PAs are threatened by these exploitations. <br/><br/>The uncontrolled bush fires:<br/>Despite the efforts made by government to sensitize and raise awareness of all the population since 1980’, uncontrolled bush fires are still reported. Most of them occur towards the end of the dry season when vegetation is too dry. These types of fires have severe consequences of the capacity of resilience of biotopes and species and contribute to the destruction of a major part of small wildlife and micro fauna. <br/><br/>Threat 3: Acceleration of the degradation of the climate conditions  <br/>The climate change and variability add up to the consequences of unsustainable practices related to natural resources exploitation by local communities. The recurrent droughts, flooding decreasing rainfall and increasing temperature are threatening the populations’ livelihoods, species and ecosystems.<br/> <br/>The support of LifeWeb Initiative is expected to contribute to a deep analysis of the national PA system in order to improve its participatory management, a political option set by the government for the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. The priority activities identified by stakeholders for this application are 3.1.2, 3.1.1, 1.1.4, 4.1.2, 2.1.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4. It is expected that their effective implementation will contribute significantly to the management of forest and wild life resources as stated in the National Framework Programme (PCGDRFF, 2006-2015), and also the Institutional and legislative reform for the decentralized management of Natural resources (PRIJD-SF, 2006).",

While some 155900 ha of forest land in National Parks (Kibale, Semuliki and parts of Ruwenzori) has been effectively protected for the most part, 173000 ha of Central Forest Reserves (around 30 CFRs of 330-82500 ha) have remained without effective management and encroachment in these has been widespread (satellite imagery, 2010 GIS analysis).

					"summary": "The project will pilot a sub-national REDD+ strategy in the Albertine Rift in south-west Uganda. This region  ranks first out of the 119 terrestrial eco-regions of continental Africa in terms of biodiversity significance, but has one of the highest deforestation rates globally, losing 17000 ha/yr. By introducing REDD+, the project will apply a transformational approach to the management of the 329000 ha of remaining forests in protected areas, safeguarding carbon stocks of 390 M tCO2eq; without such action, Central Forests Reserves (CFRs) and private forests will be cleared in less than 20 years and pressures will mount on the national parks that protect the most important biodiversity and watersheds. The project will support development of a sub-national REDD+ strategy, develop standards for REDD+ projects for forest protected areas and adjacent lands, define a corresponding MRV system, and through co-benefit arrangements will improve land security and livelihoods for 14500 forest dependent households.",
					"description": "- The project will operate in the north and north-central Albertine Rift in south-western Uganda. This represents 20% of its entire extension, from the Murchison Falls in the north to the Kibale and Ruwenzori forests in the south; noting that 60% of the Albertine Rift eco-region lies towards the west and south in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which continues to face considerable difficulties underlining the importance of forest protection in Uganda.<br/><br/><br/>- The area has already lost a large swathe of its original forests. While some 155900 ha of forest land in National Parks (Kibale, Semuliki and parts of Ruwenzori) has been effectively protected for the most part, 173000 ha of Central Forest Reserves (around 30 CFRs of 330-82500 ha) have remained without effective management and encroachment in these has been widespread (satellite imagery, 2010 GIS analysis). In addition around 113500 ha of forests remain on private lands. Together these public and private lands contain >55% of Uganda’s remaining tropical high forest and represent one of Uganda’s key carbon pools, exhibiting carbon densities between191-457 tC/ha.<br/><br/><br/>- The environmental services of the forests are critical to the poor rural households living in their vicinity: 90% of these rely on the forests for fuel wood, 50% collect non-timber forest products to supplement income or diet, 53% collect water from springs and streams inside forest areas, and 84% of houses are built using timber from local forests. Many of these people are landless in-migrants, former forest-dependent people who left now deforested areas and who retain forest dependency because of a lack of other resources on which to base their livelihoods. <br/><br/><br/>- The area experiences a population growth rate of 5.2%/yr (well above the national rate of 3.2%), high poverty levels and shortages of agricultural land. Together these pressures are leading to the clearance of c. 17000 ha of forest/yr – a total deforestation rate of 3% including a rate of 5.1% on private land, one of the highest in the world. <br/><br/><br/>- At this rate of deforestation, most forests on private land and in the weakly protected CFRs will be cleared in <20 years with a concurrent loss of up to 80% of the extant forest carbon pool. Huge pressures will then mount on the forests remaining in National Parks established to protect biodiversity and critical watersheds. <br/><br/><br/>- In the light of this situation and its profile Uganda has been an active participant in REDD+ discussions (UNFCCC, UN-REDD, FCPF, etc.). It intends to develop a national REDD+ strategy and programme, which however is still in the commitment stage. A REDD+ Readiness Preparation Proposal for Uganda (R-PP) has been conducted that identifies national actions for 2012-2014, to which sub-national strategies and experiences could substantially contribute while already making a difference on the ground where it is urgently needed.",

					"title": "Developing and testing a sub-national REDD+ strategy to safeguard the remaining forests within protected areas and on private land in Uganda’s north and north-central Albertine Rift",
					"summary": "The project will pilot a sub-national REDD+ strategy in the Albertine Rift in south-west Uganda. This region  ranks first out of the 119 terrestrial eco-regions of continental Africa in terms of biodiversity significance, but has one of the highest deforestation rates globally, losing 17000 ha/yr. By introducing REDD+, the project will apply a transformational approach to the management of the 329000 ha of remaining forests in protected areas, safeguarding carbon stocks of 390 M tCO2eq; without such action, Central Forests Reserves (CFRs) and private forests will be cleared in less than 20 years and pressures will mount on the national parks that protect the most important biodiversity and watersheds. The project will support development of a sub-national REDD+ strategy, develop standards for REDD+ projects for forest protected areas and adjacent lands, define a corresponding MRV system, and through co-benefit arrangements will improve land security and livelihoods for 14500 forest dependent households.",
					"description": "- The project will operate in the north and north-central Albertine Rift in south-western Uganda. This represents 20% of its entire extension, from the Murchison Falls in the north to the Kibale and Ruwenzori forests in the south; noting that 60% of the Albertine Rift eco-region lies towards the west and south in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which continues to face considerable difficulties underlining the importance of forest protection in Uganda.<br/><br/><br/>- The area has already lost a large swathe of its original forests. While some 155900 ha of forest land in National Parks (Kibale, Semuliki and parts of Ruwenzori) has been effectively protected for the most part, 173000 ha of Central Forest Reserves (around 30 CFRs of 330-82500 ha) have remained without effective management and encroachment in these has been widespread (satellite imagery, 2010 GIS analysis). In addition around 113500 ha of forests remain on private lands. Together these public and private lands contain >55% of Uganda’s remaining tropical high forest and represent one of Uganda’s key carbon pools, exhibiting carbon densities between191-457 tC/ha.<br/><br/><br/>- The environmental services of the forests are critical to the poor rural households living in their vicinity: 90% of these rely on the forests for fuel wood, 50% collect non-timber forest products to supplement income or diet, 53% collect water from springs and streams inside forest areas, and 84% of houses are built using timber from local forests. Many of these people are landless in-migrants, former forest-dependent people who left now deforested areas and who retain forest dependency because of a lack of other resources on which to base their livelihoods. <br/><br/><br/>- The area experiences a population growth rate of 5.2%/yr (well above the national rate of 3.2%), high poverty levels and shortages of agricultural land. Together these pressures are leading to the clearance of c. 17000 ha of forest/yr – a total deforestation rate of 3% including a rate of 5.1% on private land, one of the highest in the world. <br/><br/><br/>- At this rate of deforestation, most forests on private land and in the weakly protected CFRs will be cleared in <20 years with a concurrent loss of up to 80% of the extant forest carbon pool. Huge pressures will then mount on the forests remaining in National Parks established to protect biodiversity and critical watersheds. <br/><br/><br/>- In the light of this situation and its profile Uganda has been an active participant in REDD+ discussions (UNFCCC, UN-REDD, FCPF, etc.). It intends to develop a national REDD+ strategy and programme, which however is still in the commitment stage. A REDD+ Readiness Preparation Proposal for Uganda (R-PP) has been conducted that identifies national actions for 2012-2014, to which sub-national strategies and experiences could substantially contribute while already making a difference on the ground where it is urgently needed.",

		"title": "Development  of a National  Ranger Training Academy and Conservation Training Centre",
		"summary": "This project will increase the capacity of Belize’s National Protected Areas System to sustain globally important biodiversity and delivery of ecosystem services by professionalising and standardising protected area ranger practices.  This specialized training academy will raise the bar for protected area law enforcement, biodiversity monitoring and adaptive protected areas management.  This will contribute towards the conservation of biodiversity and maintenance of ecosystem services important in underpinning livelihoods of the rural poor.  In partnership with the University of Belize the training academy will provide formal accreditation for rangers with recognized qualifications providing a pathway to higher education for exemplary students, and a means for rangers to progress professionally into senior protected area management roles.  The longer term goal is for the training academy to become a regional centre contributing to the improvement of protected areas management across the Central America and Caribbean region.",
		"description": "<h4>Regional context</h4><br/>While the Mesoamerican isthmus represents a mere 0.7% of the earth’s land mass, it contains a staggering 9.4% of the world’s terrestrial species (Barry 2006, CI 2009).  Mesoamerica is second only to the tropical Andes in terms of biodiversity and endemism and, with its large extent of intact tropical forests, rolling mountains, open savannas, and lagoons, linking to the second largest barrier reef system in the world, its protection is of the utmost importance.  However, threats to biodiversity are increasing both in frequency and magnitude due to increasing human footprint and unsustainable resource use.  Protected Areas (PAs) are widely used in the region to conserve biodiversity and ensure that flows of ecosystem goods and services that benefit society, secure livelihoods, and contribute to the achievement of Millennium Development Goals continue in perpetuity.<br/><br/><h4>National context and threats to biodiversity in Belize</h4><br/>Belize provides a critical function within the Mesoamerican region both on land and marine.  Belize lies at the heart of La Selva Maya, a macrobiological forest corridor connecting Mexico and Guatemala with Honduras, which is in turn the second largest contiguous block of tropical forest in the Americas, after the Amazon.  The Belize Barrier Reef, a UNESCO World Heritage site further constitutes 79% of the Mesoamerican barrier reef complex, thus making a significant contribution to the conservation of the region’s reef ecosystems.  These attributes place Belize as one of the most important biodiversity refuges remaining in Mesoamerica, and indeed in the World; critical for maintenance of biodiversity nationally, as well as at regional and global scales.  <br/><br/>However, Belize’s natural ecosystems are threatened. Excessive coastal development, mangrove cutting, overfishing aquaculture and agricultural runoff are directly impacting the integrity of the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System – now categorised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site ‘in danger’ (http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/764/). In the terrestrial environment, poorly planned development, oil exploration and extraction, hydroelectric development, agricultural expansion and unsustainable practises, overharvesting and wildfires are putting increasing pressure on Belize’s natural resources, with deforestation and forest degradation, particularly along the Belize-Guatemala border, have severe implication of the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the country.  <br/><br/>Belize’s PAs form an important strategy for maintaining regionally and globally important biodiversity and the ecological processes that underpin delivery of ecosystem services in the face of a growing suite of threats.  In this regard, Belize has long been considered a leader in conservation within the Mesoamerican region, with over a million hectares (36% of terrestrial and 13% of marine area) under protection for conservation and/or sustainable resource use (timber, sustainable fisheries).  Overseeing this extensive network of protected areas is the National Protected Areas System (NPAS). This system, currently being rationalized by the NPAS secretariat, is intended to conserve the natural and  cultural  heritage  of  the  country.  Within this system Belize has an impressive range of globally recognized sites including the Belize Barrier Reef UNESCO World Heritage Site, 2 Ramsar sites, 15 Key Biodiversity Areas and 6 Important Bird Areas. Belize’s PAs also maintain viable populations of threatened species, including at least 12 amphibians, 46 birds, all coral anthozoan and hydrozoan species, 19 fish, 15 sharks, 28 mammals, 8 plants and 10 reptiles.  <br/><br/>The network of PAs collectively contribute to the continued delivery of supporting ecosystem services (e.g. clean air, carbon sequestration and storage, and climate regulation) that are of global benefit. They also provide ecosystem services, vital for the human population of Belize, including provisioning services (e.g. food, water and medicine); regulating services (e.g. flood, pest, pollutant and disease control, and crop pollination) and cultural services (e.g. educational, recreational, spiritual, cultural benefits).  Of particular importance in today’s rapidly changing climate is the physical protection that Belize’s protected areas and intact ecosystems provide against natural disasters such as hurricanes (reefs and mangroves), landslides (forested slopes) and drought (forest moisture retention and watershed protection).  Intact ecosystems have also been identified as critical to Belize’s capacity for climate change adaptation. <br/><br/>The total value of these ecosystems cannot be fully captured by economics alone. However, studies of some ecosystems within Belize have tried to quantify their value for livelihoods and the economy. The combined contribution of mangroves and reefs for shoreline protection (avoided damages), fisheries and tourism, for example, has been estimated at up to US$559 million per year in Belize (WRI, 2008). A more recent analysis of coastal fisheries, carbon, timber, non-timber forest products, tourism and minerals in the Maya Mountains Massif and Maya Mountain Marine Corridor estimated their combined value at approximately US$680 million over a 30 year timeframe (NPAC, 2011).<br/><br/>These studies highlight the important contribution of Belize’s natural ecosystems at local and national level. Maintaining their integrity is paramount.<br/><br/><h4>Gaps and Challenges for Protected Areas in Belize</h4><br/>There is no question that Belize has made significant advances to protecting critical biodiversity and ecosystem services through an extensive network of PAs. However, a series of recent NPAS assessments (NPASP 2005, Walker and Walker 2009) and the preliminary findings of the Rationalization of the NPAS (Wildtracks, 2012 in progress,) have identified key gaps and challenges that need to be addressed to achieve Belize’s biodiversity conservation goals:<br/><ol><br/>  <li>Lack of coordination between the agencies involved in PA management across the country has led to inefficiencies in enforcement of protected area laws, while poor information sharing has reduced effectiveness in preventing illegal logging, hunting and fishing. </li><br/>  <li>Lack of standardised operating practises in management, particularly in enforcement, and biodiversity monitoring prohibits consistency in addressing incompliance to PA laws and constrains the practice of science-based natural resource management. </li><br/>  <li>High proportion of ‘paper parks’ which do not effectively patrol, conduct monitoring, or implement environmental education and interpretation activities in Belize. </li><br/>  <li>Low levels of capacity exist at a number of levels within the Belize NPAS. Furthermore, management effectiveness assessments have highlighted the lack of a capacity building strategy.  In the absence of capacity development the threats facing the NPAS will continue to intensify with impacts for the rich biodiversity they contain. </li><br/>  <li>High PA staff turnover due to limited career development opportunities results in a tendency for transient employees rather than long-term, career staff.</li><br/></ol><br/>The lack of sustainable financing presents further challenges for the long-term security of NPAS.<br/><br/><h4>Strengthening Capacity for Protected Areas Management</h4><br/>In order to qualify capacity gaps within the NPAS (point 4 above), the CBD Programme of Work on Protected Areas called on its Parties to “complete national protected-area capacity needs assessments and establish capacity building programmes” (IUCN, 2011).  A highly interactive, collaborative and consultative national capacity needs assessment was carried out for Belize’s NPAS in 2011 involving Government departments, NGOs, CBOs, private sector and academic institutions.  The assessment was led by the Environmental Research Institute (ERI) at the University of Belize (UB), in partnership with Belizean NGO Ya’axché Conservation Trust (Ya’axché) and the Center for Protected Areas Management at Colorado State University (CPAM-CSU). <br/><br/>This National Protected Areas Capacity Needs Assessment (2011), identified three priorities for action:<br/><ol><br/>  <li>research and monitoring for protected area management, </li><br/>  <li>ranger training, and </li><br/>  <li>institutional capacity and strengthening.</li><br/></ol><br/>For each priority area a curriculum, lesson plans, teaching materials and assignments were developed.  <br/><br/>Ya’axché Conservation Trust and the proposed development of a National Ranger Training Academy<br/>Ya'axché is an award winning Belizean NGO which aims to maintain healthy forests, rivers and reefs for the benefit of all. Through protected area management, advocacy, and working hand in hand with communities Ya'axché strives to develop capacity for the wise use of land and natural resources in and around the Maya Golden Landscape in Toledo. Over the 14 years since its inception Ya’axché has developed its PA management experience and an expanding portfolio of coverage which includes the Bladen Nature Reserve, one of the largest and most strictly protected PAs in Belize.  Ya’axché has consistently demonstrated its adaptability, stability and innovation in achieving its strategic objectives for conservation and sustainable development.  As a leading NGO in Belize Ya’axché has played a particularly significant role in influencing national policy and strengthening the NPAS through increasing management effectiveness.  This has been achieved through a commitment to capacity building, in particular through training of the ranger team.  Ya’axché has also strived to maximise collaboration with PA stakeholders, conducting a needs assessment for Toledo-based PA managers, identifying gaps and subsequently organizing trainings and workshops. <br/><br/>Responding to the need for ranger training in Belize, Ya’axché has embarked on a pioneering initiative to develop a National Ranger Training Academy (NRTA). The concept has been the subject of extensive consultation with a broad range of stakeholders and potential collaborators and has received an unprecedented levels of support with consensus among stakeholders that it will be key to raising the bar for PA management in the NPAS through standardisation of practices leading to greater efficiency and effectiveness.  In addition to progress in identifying priority capacity needs nationally and generating broad stakeholder support, recent changes in the Government present a unique opportunity for advancing ranger training in Belize to support the country’s biodiversity conservation goals and commitments.<br/><br/>At the March 2012 national general election the incumbent government retained power and, in response to a growing number environmental and natural resource issues, took the unprecedented and bold step of splitting the Ministry of Natural Resources.  Recreated as the Ministry of Forestry, Fisheries, and Sustainable Development, the government has shown clear intent for prioritising environment and sustainable development in Belize and has appointed an award winning leader in conservation and sustainable development as Minister.  Ya’axché has a strong working relationship with the Ministry and has been a significant influence in lobbying for the strengthening of PA legislation through its advocacy.  With such strong support from Government and a supportive enabling environment for innovative and collaborative initiatives such as the Training Academy, now is a pivotal time for furthering development of the NRTA.<br/><br/><h4>Long-term Sustainability</h4><br/>The failure of PA management training programs that have been piloted in Latin America to date has been attributed to poor sustainability.   Sustainability in this context is related to institutional capacity, long-term commitment, presence of trained specialists, long term financial viability and institutional support of key stakeholders  Of these, the lack of an effective long term sustainable financing mechanism has been the most common cause of failure for initiatives in the region (Jim Barborak, CPAMT - CSU).<br/><br/>Ya’axché has the institutional capacity to develop the project with committed support from key stakeholders, authorities and long term partners including:<br/><ul><br/>  <li> Ministry of Forestry Fisheries and Sustainable Development </li><br/>  <li> University of Belize – Environmental Research Institute</li><br/>  <li> Association of Protected Areas Management Organizations (APAMO)</li><br/>  <li> Belize Coastguard</li><br/>  <li> Fauna and Flora International </li><br/></ul><br/>To overcome the challenge of securing financial sustainability for the Training Academy, Ya’axché has undertaken an extensive assessment of potential revenue sources available to the organization and the NRTA.  Educational eco-tourism was identified as a viable source of income for the NRTA with three main target markets:<br/><ol><br/>  <li> Paying volunteers/interns, </li><br/>  <li> partnerships with academic institutions, and </li><br/>  <li> day trip ecotourists. </li><br/></ol><br/>A rigorous market survey  was undertaken to determine their viability and potential in meeting the projected running costs of the NRTA.   The results of this survey were positive and all three markets were considered viable with the paying volunteer/intern market as the most appropriate and promising. <br/><br/>To maintain a functional separation between the sustainable financing program and the NRTA, the Ya’axché Institute for Conservation Education (YICE) will be established on the same site and will utilize the facilities and educators outside of the ranger training season which falls in the wet season (between July – September) which is generally the quietest time for PA managers due to low tourist season, reduced illegal hunting and low fire risk.  100% of the revenue generated from the YICE will be used to fund the operational costs of the NRTA and YICE and will contribute towards PA management in southern Belize where the Academy is to be hosted.  A fully elaborated business plan for the NRTA and YICE has been completed confirming the viability of these ventures and their financial sustainability.<br/><br/>There is a clear and urgent need for the establishment of a fully functional and financially sustainable National Ranger Training Academy in Belize to raise the bar of PA management across the country and to support Belize’s conservation goals and commitments. Ya’axché is in a unique position to lead the development of the NRTA, with support from all partners, and to ensure its long term sustainability and success.  Ya’axché is therefore seeking funding to finance the construction, development, marketing and start up of the NRTA and YICE over a 4 year period. After this period the Training Academy will be financial sustainability and able to continue building the individual and institutional capacity to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services for Belize over the long term.",

		"ecological_contribution": "This project will contribute towards the improved management of Belize’s NPAS and those ecologically important areas outside the NPAS (e.g. community lands, private protected areas and private lands) such as those owned and managed for tourism purposes. The project thus has the potential to make a significant ecological contribution. <br/><br/>The importance of Belize’s NPAS and adjacent areas of natural habitat <br/>Belize has some of the most intact, forested areas left in Central America with three major identified forested nodes:<br/>1.\tThe Maya Mountains Massif forms a regionally important forest node in south-central Belize; <br/>2.\tAguas Turbias National Park and the adjacent Rio Bravo Conservation and Management Area (one of eight private protected areas recognized as part of the National Protected Areas System) form part of the Selva Maya, with trans-national linkages to Guatemala and Mexico;<br/>3.\tShipstern / Fireburn of north-east Belize form the third node. <br/>These forested areas and their high biodiversity values, as well as continuing low levels of human impact (compared to other parts of the region), place Belize as one of the most important biodiversity refuges remaining in Mesoamerica, critical for maintenance of biodiversity not only on the national scale, but also on the regional scale.<br/><br/>Unlike many of its neighbours, Belize still has significant connectivity between two of its three major forested nodes – between the Maya Mountains Massif and the Selva Maya (Rio Bravo). Belize participated in the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor Programme (MBCP) developed through ALIDES, the regional development strategy under the Central American Commission for the Environment and Development.  The MBCP was designed to harmonise Central America's territorial priorities in terms of conservation, whilst “balancing biodiversity protection with forest management and productive landscape restoration” (Herrera). Belize’s intact forest system has been highlighted for its importance in an ecoregional planning exercise by The Nature Conservancy and for its contribution to the Selva Maya Corridor, the second largest contiguous area of tropical rainforest in the Americas, after the Amazon (CEPF 2004).<br/><br/>Comprehensiveness of the NPAS<br/>In 2005, the NPAS was considered relatively – but not completely – comprehensive in terms of ecosystem coverage.  Further rationalisation of the NPAS is ongoing (see attached interim report) to evaluate ecosystem representation and interconnectivity of PAs within the NPAS with a view to consolidating the system and ensuring its comprehensiveness. Whilst the rationalisation exercise is ongoing preliminary findings highlight that despite the adoption of the management plan framework put forward by the NPASP in accordance with the IUCN category recommendations “there are still considerably disjointed and non-standardized approaches to management across the national system.”  <br/><br/>Assessments of the status and management effectiveness of PAs (Walker 2009) also identified:<br/>•\t“Limitations in terms of biodiversity protection and management, with protection of the forests, but not of the fauna” suggesting critical gaps in management effectiveness across Belize’s NPAS. <br/>o\tThe NRTA will make a valuable contribution to addressing identified deficiencies by improving the efficiency of patrols.  More observant, better trained and more knowledgeable PA rangers will contribute to a reduction in illegal hunting activities and illegal deforestation therefore helping to maintain faunal biodiversity and populations.<br/>•\tThat managers of terrestrial PAs have a tendency to over-rate the effectiveness  of  their  surveillance  and  enforcement,  and  do  not  adequately  scale  these  activities in proportion with the impacts on biodiversity. The review stressed that significantly more support is required  from  the  Forest  Department,  Belize  Defense  Force,  Police  Department  and legal  structures  in  this  regard.  <br/>o\tThe NRTA will address these capacity gaps through training in PA legislation, wildlife protection act and forest act in addition to the delivery of the Special Constable training program, in partnership with the Police Department, with a particular focus on evidence collection and case building.<br/>•\tProtected Areas managers generally rate the effectiveness of the enforcement activities at the upper end of MODERATE. However, biodiversity indicators demonstrate that enforcement levels are inadequate for maintenance of key indicator species. There is an urgent need for staff and  authority recognition of current enforcement limitations, and significant strengthening of enforcement capacity and implementation.  <br/><br/>The NRTA responds directly to many of the recommendations that emerged from this assessment and in particular the need to ‘prioritize capacity building for protected area managers and staff (Government and non-Government) to strengthen enforcement, and prioritize implementation, particularly of terrestrial protected areas’. <br/><br/>Drawing on learning from regional initiatives to maximise ecological contribution of the NRTA:<br/>The Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS) project was not highlighted in the National Protected Areas Policy (NPAP). However, this initiative has led to increased communication and collaboration among the marine protected areas, and standardised data collection, resulting in the marine protected areas being within a more effective network than their terrestrial counterparts, and better integrated into the regional protected areas network through the Mesoamerican Reef (MAR) concept.  <br/><br/>The NRTA will draw lessons from the MBRS initiative for strengthening communication, collaboration and standardisation of data collection.  In partnership with the National Protected Areas Training Program recently launched by the UB-ERI and the forthcoming National Biodiversity Monitoring Planning committee the NRTA can ensure that PA rangers across the country are equipped with the skills to conduct biodiversity monitoring.",

Healthy and intact ecosystems play an important role in delivering services that help people adapt to climate change and to support the maintenance of resilient landscapes. <br/><br/>The project will thus contribute towards Belize’s capacity for ecosystem-based adaptation in some of the following ways: <br/>•\tClimate change impacts are expected to increase the size, intensity and frequency of wildfires, exacerbated by an increase in uncontrolled human-induced fires. The NRTA will build capacity for more effective, ranger led wildlife management. With many rangers coming from within communities buffering the PAs, improved fire management capacity can help to promote more effective community-based wildfire management.<br/>•\tCapacity for watershed management will be improved through the NRTA thereby helping to secure future delivery of important ecosystem goods and services upon which natural resource based livelihoods, particularly among rural communities and those considered ‘cash-poor’,  in Belize depend. <br/>•\tImproved capacity for the maintenance of mangrove and other coastal habitats that are crucial for mitigating the impacts of hurricanes and tropical storms along the coastline.<br/>•\tImproved capacity to protect the biological diversity contained within the NPAS will contribute to community resilience through protection of medicinal biodiversity.<br/>•\tImproved capacity to protect and maintain ecosystem function of PAs and corridors between them will contribute to ecosystem resilience.<br/>The NRTA project will further raise awareness of the threats facing PAs, their implications for biodiversity, ecosystem services and local people, and the importance of PA’s for ecosystem-based adaptation in a changing climate.

The value of HS to maintaining potable water supply was estimated at US$2.3m NPV.

The NPASP specifically identified  the following capacity weaknesses:<br/>•\tLack of biodiversity evaluation and monitoring capability<br/>•\tLack of enforcement capability<br/>The proposed NRTA will directly address these weaknesses through building the capacity of PA rangers to collect standardised monitoring data  and increase the standards and effectiveness of PA enforcement across the NPAS.<br/><br/>Meerman J., Wilson J.R., 2005, The Belize National Protected Areas System Plan (http://biological-diversity.info/Downloads/NPAPSP/NPAPSP_2005.pdf)<br/><br/><br/>3)\tHorizon 2030 is Belize’s national development framework which establishes long‐term development goals and objectives, intended to strategically guide Belize’s development over the next 20 years. The approach is cross-sectoral and highlights the need to adopt and implement the National Protected areas policy and system plan, in addition to international and regional obligations such as the Millennium Development goals.  Horizon 2030 aims to strengthen protected areas management through the implementation of the National Protected Areas Systems Plan and by strengthening the legal and administrative framework for protected areas. It also addresses the need to enforce environmental protection laws in a fair and just manner.<br/><br/>Barnett and Company Ltd, 2011, Horizon 2030 – Planning our future together (http://www.belize.gov.bz/public/Attachment/2598371571.pdf)<br/><br/><br/>4)\tThe Belize Millennium Development Goals Scorecard. This document  outlines (i) the progress that has been achieved to date; and (ii) the prospects for achievement of agreed targets (for 2015) in the light of existing and anticipated policies and programmes.  Belize committed to achieving the eight goals and the goal that pertains to this project is goal 7, Ensure Environmental Sustainability.  Given increasing pressures on biodiversity and natural habitats, Belize faces significant challenges in achieving its MDG7 targets with respect to biological diversity conservation.  It makes the following recommendations:<br/>•\tBelize has policy and legislative instruments in place to combat the decline in biodiversity and this would further require better coordination, management and enforcement among national implementing bodies.<br/>•\tImprove development and application of robust monitoring frameworks and maintain impartial enforcement of all regulations<br/>•\tBelize would also need to address the issues of species extraction, especially regarding those species that are directly affected by cross-border movements over which the Belize Government has limited control and legislative impact.<br/>•\tIncrease community participation in environmental management initiatives as one of the main strategies to reverse loss of resources.<br/>These recommendations are directly addressed by the proposal for the NRTA, in the following ways:   <br/>•\tOne of the primary goals of the NRTA is to improve coordination, management and enforcement from the grass roots level in the NPAS.  <br/>•\tThe NRTA will work together with UB-ERI and the National Protected Areas Commission to build the capacity of PA rangers to collect valuable monitoring data and taking advantage of the amount of time they spend in the field.  <br/>•\tPreventing the Illegal extraction of species is one of the main tasks of the PA ranger and the NRTA will increase patrol effectiveness and PA law enforcement to mitigate this threat.  <br/>•\tPA rangers are often members of the stakeholder communities to PAs, recognizing this the NRTA has a specific unit dealing with community participation in PA management and conflict resolution. <br/><br/>Belize MDG Scorecard and outlook report – 2010 (http://www.undp.org.bz/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Belize-MDG-Report-2010.pdf)",

					"description": "<h4>Regional context</h4><br/>While the Mesoamerican isthmus represents a mere 0.7% of the earth’s land mass, it contains a staggering 9.4% of the world’s terrestrial species (Barry 2006, CI 2009).  Mesoamerica is second only to the tropical Andes in terms of biodiversity and endemism and, with its large extent of intact tropical forests, rolling mountains, open savannas, and lagoons, linking to the second largest barrier reef system in the world, its protection is of the utmost importance.  However, threats to biodiversity are increasing both in frequency and magnitude due to increasing human footprint and unsustainable resource use.  Protected Areas (PAs) are widely used in the region to conserve biodiversity and ensure that flows of ecosystem goods and services that benefit society, secure livelihoods, and contribute to the achievement of Millennium Development Goals continue in perpetuity.<br/><br/><h4>National context and threats to biodiversity in Belize</h4><br/>Belize provides a critical function within the Mesoamerican region both on land and marine.  Belize lies at the heart of La Selva Maya, a macrobiological forest corridor connecting Mexico and Guatemala with Honduras, which is in turn the second largest contiguous block of tropical forest in the Americas, after the Amazon.  The Belize Barrier Reef, a UNESCO World Heritage site further constitutes 79% of the Mesoamerican barrier reef complex, thus making a significant contribution to the conservation of the region’s reef ecosystems.  These attributes place Belize as one of the most important biodiversity refuges remaining in Mesoamerica, and indeed in the World; critical for maintenance of biodiversity nationally, as well as at regional and global scales.  <br/><br/>However, Belize’s natural ecosystems are threatened. Excessive coastal development, mangrove cutting, overfishing aquaculture and agricultural runoff are directly impacting the integrity of the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System – now categorised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site ‘in danger’ (http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/764/). In the terrestrial environment, poorly planned development, oil exploration and extraction, hydroelectric development, agricultural expansion and unsustainable practises, overharvesting and wildfires are putting increasing pressure on Belize’s natural resources, with deforestation and forest degradation, particularly along the Belize-Guatemala border, have severe implication of the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the country.  <br/><br/>Belize’s PAs form an important strategy for maintaining regionally and globally important biodiversity and the ecological processes that underpin delivery of ecosystem services in the face of a growing suite of threats.  In this regard, Belize has long been considered a leader in conservation within the Mesoamerican region, with over a million hectares (36% of terrestrial and 13% of marine area) under protection for conservation and/or sustainable resource use (timber, sustainable fisheries).  Overseeing this extensive network of protected areas is the National Protected Areas System (NPAS). This system, currently being rationalized by the NPAS secretariat, is intended to conserve the natural and  cultural  heritage  of  the  country.  Within this system Belize has an impressive range of globally recognized sites including the Belize Barrier Reef UNESCO World Heritage Site, 2 Ramsar sites, 15 Key Biodiversity Areas and 6 Important Bird Areas. Belize’s PAs also maintain viable populations of threatened species, including at least 12 amphibians, 46 birds, all coral anthozoan and hydrozoan species, 19 fish, 15 sharks, 28 mammals, 8 plants and 10 reptiles.  <br/><br/>The network of PAs collectively contribute to the continued delivery of supporting ecosystem services (e.g. clean air, carbon sequestration and storage, and climate regulation) that are of global benefit. They also provide ecosystem services, vital for the human population of Belize, including provisioning services (e.g. food, water and medicine); regulating services (e.g. flood, pest, pollutant and disease control, and crop pollination) and cultural services (e.g. educational, recreational, spiritual, cultural benefits).  Of particular importance in today’s rapidly changing climate is the physical protection that Belize’s protected areas and intact ecosystems provide against natural disasters such as hurricanes (reefs and mangroves), landslides (forested slopes) and drought (forest moisture retention and watershed protection).  Intact ecosystems have also been identified as critical to Belize’s capacity for climate change adaptation. <br/><br/>The total value of these ecosystems cannot be fully captured by economics alone. However, studies of some ecosystems within Belize have tried to quantify their value for livelihoods and the economy. The combined contribution of mangroves and reefs for shoreline protection (avoided damages), fisheries and tourism, for example, has been estimated at up to US$559 million per year in Belize (WRI, 2008). A more recent analysis of coastal fisheries, carbon, timber, non-timber forest products, tourism and minerals in the Maya Mountains Massif and Maya Mountain Marine Corridor estimated their combined value at approximately US$680 million over a 30 year timeframe (NPAC, 2011).<br/><br/>These studies highlight the important contribution of Belize’s natural ecosystems at local and national level. Maintaining their integrity is paramount.<br/><br/><h4>Gaps and Challenges for Protected Areas in Belize</h4><br/>There is no question that Belize has made significant advances to protecting critical biodiversity and ecosystem services through an extensive network of PAs. However, a series of recent NPAS assessments (NPASP 2005, Walker and Walker 2009) and the preliminary findings of the Rationalization of the NPAS (Wildtracks, 2012 in progress,) have identified key gaps and challenges that need to be addressed to achieve Belize’s biodiversity conservation goals:<br/><ol><br/>  <li>Lack of coordination between the agencies involved in PA management across the country has led to inefficiencies in enforcement of protected area laws, while poor information sharing has reduced effectiveness in preventing illegal logging, hunting and fishing. </li><br/>  <li>Lack of standardised operating practises in management, particularly in enforcement, and biodiversity monitoring prohibits consistency in addressing incompliance to PA laws and constrains the practice of science-based natural resource management. </li><br/>  <li>High proportion of ‘paper parks’ which do not effectively patrol, conduct monitoring, or implement environmental education and interpretation activities in Belize. </li><br/>  <li>Low levels of capacity exist at a number of levels within the Belize NPAS. Furthermore, management effectiveness assessments have highlighted the lack of a capacity building strategy.  In the absence of capacity development the threats facing the NPAS will continue to intensify with impacts for the rich biodiversity they contain. </li><br/>  <li>High PA staff turnover due to limited career development opportunities results in a tendency for transient employees rather than long-term, career staff.</li><br/></ol><br/>The lack of sustainable financing presents further challenges for the long-term security of NPAS.<br/><br/><h4>Strengthening Capacity for Protected Areas Management</h4><br/>In order to qualify capacity gaps within the NPAS (point 4 above), the CBD Programme of Work on Protected Areas called on its Parties to “complete national protected-area capacity needs assessments and establish capacity building programmes” (IUCN, 2011).  A highly interactive, collaborative and consultative national capacity needs assessment was carried out for Belize’s NPAS in 2011 involving Government departments, NGOs, CBOs, private sector and academic institutions.  The assessment was led by the Environmental Research Institute (ERI) at the University of Belize (UB), in partnership with Belizean NGO Ya’axché Conservation Trust (Ya’axché) and the Center for Protected Areas Management at Colorado State University (CPAM-CSU). <br/><br/>This National Protected Areas Capacity Needs Assessment (2011), identified three priorities for action:<br/><ol><br/>  <li>research and monitoring for protected area management, </li><br/>  <li>ranger training, and </li><br/>  <li>institutional capacity and strengthening.</li><br/></ol><br/>For each priority area a curriculum, lesson plans, teaching materials and assignments were developed.  <br/><br/>Ya’axché Conservation Trust and the proposed development of a National Ranger Training Academy<br/>Ya'axché is an award winning Belizean NGO which aims to maintain healthy forests, rivers and reefs for the benefit of all. Through protected area management, advocacy, and working hand in hand with communities Ya'axché strives to develop capacity for the wise use of land and natural resources in and around the Maya Golden Landscape in Toledo. Over the 14 years since its inception Ya’axché has developed its PA management experience and an expanding portfolio of coverage which includes the Bladen Nature Reserve, one of the largest and most strictly protected PAs in Belize.  Ya’axché has consistently demonstrated its adaptability, stability and innovation in achieving its strategic objectives for conservation and sustainable development.  As a leading NGO in Belize Ya’axché has played a particularly significant role in influencing national policy and strengthening the NPAS through increasing management effectiveness.  This has been achieved through a commitment to capacity building, in particular through training of the ranger team.  Ya’axché has also strived to maximise collaboration with PA stakeholders, conducting a needs assessment for Toledo-based PA managers, identifying gaps and subsequently organizing trainings and workshops. <br/><br/>Responding to the need for ranger training in Belize, Ya’axché has embarked on a pioneering initiative to develop a National Ranger Training Academy (NRTA). The concept has been the subject of extensive consultation with a broad range of stakeholders and potential collaborators and has received an unprecedented levels of support with consensus among stakeholders that it will be key to raising the bar for PA management in the NPAS through standardisation of practices leading to greater efficiency and effectiveness.  In addition to progress in identifying priority capacity needs nationally and generating broad stakeholder support, recent changes in the Government present a unique opportunity for advancing ranger training in Belize to support the country’s biodiversity conservation goals and commitments.<br/><br/>At the March 2012 national general election the incumbent government retained power and, in response to a growing number environmental and natural resource issues, took the unprecedented and bold step of splitting the Ministry of Natural Resources.  Recreated as the Ministry of Forestry, Fisheries, and Sustainable Development, the government has shown clear intent for prioritising environment and sustainable development in Belize and has appointed an award winning leader in conservation and sustainable development as Minister.  Ya’axché has a strong working relationship with the Ministry and has been a significant influence in lobbying for the strengthening of PA legislation through its advocacy.  With such strong support from Government and a supportive enabling environment for innovative and collaborative initiatives such as the Training Academy, now is a pivotal time for furthering development of the NRTA.<br/><br/><h4>Long-term Sustainability</h4><br/>The failure of PA management training programs that have been piloted in Latin America to date has been attributed to poor sustainability.   Sustainability in this context is related to institutional capacity, long-term commitment, presence of trained specialists, long term financial viability and institutional support of key stakeholders  Of these, the lack of an effective long term sustainable financing mechanism has been the most common cause of failure for initiatives in the region (Jim Barborak, CPAMT - CSU).<br/><br/>Ya’axché has the institutional capacity to develop the project with committed support from key stakeholders, authorities and long term partners including:<br/><ul><br/>  <li> Ministry of Forestry Fisheries and Sustainable Development </li><br/>  <li> University of Belize – Environmental Research Institute</li><br/>  <li> Association of Protected Areas Management Organizations (APAMO)</li><br/>  <li> Belize Coastguard</li><br/>  <li> Fauna and Flora International </li><br/></ul><br/>To overcome the challenge of securing financial sustainability for the Training Academy, Ya’axché has undertaken an extensive assessment of potential revenue sources available to the organization and the NRTA.  Educational eco-tourism was identified as a viable source of income for the NRTA with three main target markets:<br/><ol><br/>  <li> Paying volunteers/interns, </li><br/>  <li> partnerships with academic institutions, and </li><br/>  <li> day trip ecotourists. </li><br/></ol><br/>A rigorous market survey  was undertaken to determine their viability and potential in meeting the projected running costs of the NRTA.   The results of this survey were positive and all three markets were considered viable with the paying volunteer/intern market as the most appropriate and promising. <br/><br/>To maintain a functional separation between the sustainable financing program and the NRTA, the Ya’axché Institute for Conservation Education (YICE) will be established on the same site and will utilize the facilities and educators outside of the ranger training season which falls in the wet season (between July – September) which is generally the quietest time for PA managers due to low tourist season, reduced illegal hunting and low fire risk.  100% of the revenue generated from the YICE will be used to fund the operational costs of the NRTA and YICE and will contribute towards PA management in southern Belize where the Academy is to be hosted.  A fully elaborated business plan for the NRTA and YICE has been completed confirming the viability of these ventures and their financial sustainability.<br/><br/>There is a clear and urgent need for the establishment of a fully functional and financially sustainable National Ranger Training Academy in Belize to raise the bar of PA management across the country and to support Belize’s conservation goals and commitments. Ya’axché is in a unique position to lead the development of the NRTA, with support from all partners, and to ensure its long term sustainability and success.  Ya’axché is therefore seeking funding to finance the construction, development, marketing and start up of the NRTA and YICE over a 4 year period. After this period the Training Academy will be financial sustainability and able to continue building the individual and institutional capacity to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services for Belize over the long term.",

A highly interactive, collaborative and consultative national capacity needs assessment was carried out for Belize’s NPAS in 2011 involving Government departments, NGOs, CBOs, private sector and academic institutions.  The assessment was led by the Environmental Research Institute (ERI) at the University of Belize (UB), in partnership with Belizean NGO Ya’axché Conservation Trust (Ya’axché) and the Center for Protected Areas Management at Colorado State University (CPAM-CSU). <br/><br/>This National Protected Areas Capacity Needs Assessment (2011), identified three priorities for action:<br/><ol><br/>  <li>research and monitoring for protected area management, </li><br/>  <li>ranger training, and </li><br/>  <li>institutional capacity and strengthening.</li><br/></ol><br/>For each priority area a curriculum, lesson plans, teaching materials and assignments were developed.  <br/><br/>Ya’axché Conservation Trust and the proposed development of a National Ranger Training Academy<br/>Ya'axché is an award winning Belizean NGO which aims to maintain healthy forests, rivers and reefs for the benefit of all. Through protected area management, advocacy, and working hand in hand with communities Ya'axché strives to develop capacity for the wise use of land and natural resources in and around the Maya Golden Landscape in Toledo. Over the 14 years since its inception Ya’axché has developed its PA management experience and an expanding portfolio of coverage which includes the Bladen Nature Reserve, one of the largest and most strictly protected PAs in Belize.  Ya’axché has consistently demonstrated its adaptability, stability and innovation in achieving its strategic objectives for conservation and sustainable development.  As a leading NGO in Belize Ya’axché has played a particularly significant role in influencing national policy and strengthening the NPAS through increasing management effectiveness.  This has been achieved through a commitment to capacity building, in particular through training of the ranger team.  Ya’axché has also strived to maximise collaboration with PA stakeholders, conducting a needs assessment for Toledo-based PA managers, identifying gaps and subsequently organizing trainings and workshops. <br/><br/>Responding to the need for ranger training in Belize, Ya’axché has embarked on a pioneering initiative to develop a National Ranger Training Academy (NRTA). The concept has been the subject of extensive consultation with a broad range of stakeholders and potential collaborators and has received an unprecedented levels of support with consensus among stakeholders that it will be key to raising the bar for PA management in the NPAS through standardisation of practices leading to greater efficiency and effectiveness.  In addition to progress in identifying priority capacity needs nationally and generating broad stakeholder support, recent changes in the Government present a unique opportunity for advancing ranger training in Belize to support the country’s biodiversity conservation goals and commitments.<br/><br/>At the March 2012 national general election the incumbent government retained power and, in response to a growing number environmental and natural resource issues, took the unprecedented and bold step of splitting the Ministry of Natural Resources.  Recreated as the Ministry of Forestry, Fisheries, and Sustainable Development, the government has shown clear intent for prioritising environment and sustainable development in Belize and has appointed an award winning leader in conservation and sustainable development as Minister.  Ya’axché has a strong working relationship with the Ministry and has been a significant influence in lobbying for the strengthening of PA legislation through its advocacy.  With such strong support from Government and a supportive enabling environment for innovative and collaborative initiatives such as the Training Academy, now is a pivotal time for furthering development of the NRTA.<br/><br/><h4>Long-term Sustainability</h4><br/>The failure of PA management training programs that have been piloted in Latin America to date has been attributed to poor sustainability.   Sustainability in this context is related to institutional capacity, long-term commitment, presence of trained specialists, long term financial viability and institutional support of key stakeholders  Of these, the lack of an effective long term sustainable financing mechanism has been the most common cause of failure for initiatives in the region (Jim Barborak, CPAMT - CSU).<br/><br/>Ya’axché has the institutional capacity to develop the project with committed support from key stakeholders, authorities and long term partners including:<br/><ul><br/>  <li> Ministry of Forestry Fisheries and Sustainable Development </li><br/>  <li> University of Belize – Environmental Research Institute</li><br/>  <li> Association of Protected Areas Management Organizations (APAMO)</li><br/>  <li> Belize Coastguard</li><br/>  <li> Fauna and Flora International </li><br/></ul><br/>To overcome the challenge of securing financial sustainability for the Training Academy, Ya’axché has undertaken an extensive assessment of potential revenue sources available to the organization and the NRTA.  Educational eco-tourism was identified as a viable source of income for the NRTA with three main target markets:<br/><ol><br/>  <li> Paying volunteers/interns, </li><br/>  <li> partnerships with academic institutions, and </li><br/>  <li> day trip ecotourists. </li><br/></ol><br/>A rigorous market survey  was undertaken to determine their viability and potential in meeting the projected running costs of the NRTA.   The results of this survey were positive and all three markets were considered viable with the paying volunteer/intern market as the most appropriate and promising. <br/><br/>To maintain a functional separation between the sustainable financing program and the NRTA, the Ya’axché Institute for Conservation Education (YICE) will be established on the same site and will utilize the facilities and educators outside of the ranger training season which falls in the wet season (between July – September) which is generally the quietest time for PA managers due to low tourist season, reduced illegal hunting and low fire risk.  100% of the revenue generated from the YICE will be used to fund the operational costs of the NRTA and YICE and will contribute towards PA management in southern Belize where the Academy is to be hosted.  A fully elaborated business plan for the NRTA and YICE has been completed confirming the viability of these ventures and their financial sustainability.<br/><br/>There is a clear and urgent need for the establishment of a fully functional and financially sustainable National Ranger Training Academy in Belize to raise the bar of PA management across the country and to support Belize’s conservation goals and commitments. Ya’axché is in a unique position to lead the development of the NRTA, with support from all partners, and to ensure its long term sustainability and success.  Ya’axché is therefore seeking funding to finance the construction, development, marketing and start up of the NRTA and YICE over a 4 year period. After this period the Training Academy will be financial sustainability and able to continue building the individual and institutional capacity to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services for Belize over the long term.",

		"summary": "This project will enable mechanisms to provide critical financing to ensure effective protected areas management, long term functionality and resiliency of the Belize’s National Protected Areas System. Additionally, the integration of significant components, such as marine and terrestrial-based ecosystem adaptation for climate change, coral reef resilience, forest resilience and opportunities to increase social resilience among vulnerable populations will enable an expanded role for protected areas to meet new challenges emanating from climate change.",
		"description": "This project is designed to give continuity and ensure successful implementation of key outstanding activities identified in the National Protected Areas System Plan (NPASP). It is based on the results of a consultative prioritization process to develop the Operational Framework, which sets out the priority areas of actions for NPASP implementation. <br/><br/>The National Protected Area Policy, developed in 2005, is the key statement on the role and management of protected areas in Belize, whereas the National Protected Area System Plan (NPASP) has been designed to implement the policy. The NPASP emphasises specific strategic actions to create a National Protected Area System in which all important sites are included in one coherent framework that meets all obligations under international agreements to which Belize is signatory.<br/><br/>In January 2006, the Belize National Protected Areas Policy and System Plan were presented to the Belizean public/stakeholders at a national stakeholder forum, which involved a total of 49 groups representing a cross-section of non-government, government, civil society, private interests, regional and international organizations and protected area managers. Additionally, stakeholders planning retreats have been conducted to prioritize principal themes, to identify concrete objectives, to develop action areas and to define measurable results for implementation of the NPASP. Participants of the stakeholder planning retreats included over 50 different national governmental, non-governmental, community-based, and private sector organizations, as well as all the international conservation non-governmental organizations that operate within Belize.<br/><br/>The NPASP development and the thematic prioritization have involved extensive studies and widespread consultations.  As such this project, which is based on the results of the NPASP thematic prioritization, represents the consensus view among those people directly involved or affected by protected areas in Belize. Throughout project design and implementation, the project envisages adopting similar consultative processes. However, to ensure continued representation across sectors, the Minister of Natural Resources in November 2007 appointed the National Protected Areas Commission (NPAC) to oversee the implementation of the NPASP. However, the NPAC based on recommendation from the NPAC Technical Review Committee set up in 2010, which was appointed by the Minister of Natural Resources to streamline the functionality and operations of NPAC, was renamed the National Protected Areas Technical Committee (NPATC). The NPATC is comprised of representatives from the various governmental protected areas agencies, as well as representatives from the following sectors: NGO’s, community-based organizations, indigenous groups and vulnerable peoples, and the private sector.  In October 2010, the Ministry of Natural Resources instituted the National Protected Areas Secretariat, housed in the Ministry of Natural Resources, to coordinate the implementation of the NPAPSP. <br/><br/>The general aim is for the national protected areas system to be comprehensive, with representative examples of all ecosystems in the country and including areas providing important environmental services, possessing exceptional scenic values and providing critical habitat for species of conservation concern or economic importance. Overall, this project will contribute toward the implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity’s Programme of Work on Protected Areas and is consistent with meeting the 2012 objective of the establishment and maintenance for marine areas of comprehensive, effectively managed, and ecologically representative national and regional systems of protected areas.<br/><br/>However, with a wide range of increasing pressures and threats that include climate change, unsustainable resources extraction practices, increasing development impacts, and impacts from tourism, effective management of these protected areas is becoming more and more urgent if Belize is to continue to maintain its natural resources for critical environmental services, sustainable use, economic contribution to the nation, and to meet its international commitments. Climate change poses significant and varied threats to the protected area system, has already resulted in severe coral bleaching events, and has arguably been responsible for increased storm events and associated damage to the reef, forest structure, agricultural areas and loss of life. Despite accepted theory and evidence, protected area managers (both marine and terrestrial) remain largely unprepared for the implementation of adaptation and mitigation strategies and actions (The Status of Protected Areas in Belize, 2009).",

		"ecological_contribution": "Aware of the need to conserve and manage this vast biological and cultural richness, Belize has declared a series of protected areas which total 111 comprising the national protected areas system of Belize and account for a total coverage of 1,064,729.95 hectares, representing 22.8% of the national territory (Source: Lands Information Centre, 2011).  The protected areas system comprises national parks, nature reserves, wildlife sanctuaries, bird sanctuaries, natural monuments, forest reserves, marine reserves, archaeological sites and archaeological reserves, as well as private reserves, strategic biological corridors and scenic landscapes of geomorphic significance.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Belize has a very high level of terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity as evidenced by more than 150 spp. of mammals, 540 spp. of birds, 151 spp. of amphibians and reptiles, nearly 600 spp. of freshwater and marine fishes and 3,408 spp. of vascular plants. The country is unique, not only in the total number of species present, but also in the vast array of ecotypes and their species richness. The Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS), stretching the full length of Belize's coastline, is the second largest in the world. The diversity of corals and related reef dwellers as well as its sheer size, has qualified this reef to be declared a World Heritage Site, in recognition of its rich biodiversity and consequent global importance. <br/><br/>However, the results of the ecological gaps identified in the NPASP – Protected Areas System Assessment & Analysis: Gap Analysis (Meerman, 2005) indicate that it is clear that certain ecosystems are under-represented in the system while some ecosystems are currently not covered at all within the Protected Areas System or do not even meet the 10% minimum IUCN requirements. Notably, the largest gaps appear to be in the northern Belize district, the southern Orange Walk district and the eastern Cayo districts.<br/><br/>Thus, the ecological contribution of the project will result from the implementation of those activities identified in the NPAPSP, which include:<br/><br/>• Prepare Economic Valuation of the northwestern forests of Belize (one of the terrestrial bioregions highlighted in the NPASP); <br/>• Prepare comprehensive technical assessments and management tools for the Belize Barrier Reef system and the north-western forests; <br/>• Conduct detailed feasibility studies for the seven key geographic areas to confirm their actual or potential importance to the national PA system (e.g., central northern coastal plain, the east-central Belize Valley, Turneffe Atoll, and the Moho River etc.); Strengthen biodiversity base-line and monitoring programmes in terrestrial Pas; and<br/>• Support activities to consolidate Belize’s protected areas system by amalgamating adjacent sites into single multi-zoned management units, allowing a more coherent approach at a landscape and seascape level.",

Additionally, protected areas often act as important barriers for land conversion. More importantly, they are enormous natural carbon sinks and play a key role in global climate regulation and in preventing further carbon emissions caused by land conversion and degradation. <br/><br/> A recent valuation of the primary environmental goods and services (EGS) produced by the Maya Mountain Massif (MMM) and Maya Mountain Marine Corridor (terrestrial area) shows that the net present value of carbon storage for the study area is US $ 9-165 million, discounted over a 30 year period. The values of forest cover, when considering both timber and carbon sequestration, is very high relative to the other EGS in the study area. For this reason, managing forest value is largely equivalent to managing for the suite of EGS from an economic perspective.<br/><br/>Additionally, there is the potential to use secure, well-managed forest protected areas as a basis for REDD funding as protected areas provide ideal delivery mechanisms for both sequestration and ecosystem based adaptation."

These estimates will be based on a combination of remote sensing data and on the ground estimates by forest type and soil type (consistent with IPPC guidelines at the Tier 2 level initially). Of the total area of Belize, approximately 62.7% is forested (~1.7 mil ha) and of that 43% (~728434 ha) is under conservation legislation, this evidences the fact that the Government of Belize is committed to the objectives of REDD. Forests in Belize are protected as national parks, forests reserves, nature reserves, and private reserves each with varying levels of protection from strict conservation to extractive use. Furthermore, the terrestrial protected areas also offer a range of ecosystem services including erosion and flood control, sediment retention, and carbon storage.<br/><br/>Marine protected areas, comprising various coastal and marine ecosystems, which include coral reef, sea grass and mangrove offer a variety of coastal and marine services, such as providing critical protection against erosion and wave-induced damages from tropical storms, protection against sea-level rises and the increased frequency of natural disasters, rising temperatures and extreme weather events due to climate change. Natural features, such as coral reefs and mangroves, are the most cost-effective options for maintaining coastal integrity. The value of mangroves as coastal protection in Belize has been estimated to be US$174–$249 million, some independently and some through their supporting role for nearby coral reefs. Furthermore, the Belize Barrier Reef can mitigate over ¾ of wave energy and provide an estimated US$120–$180 million in avoided damages per year while coastal mangroves offer protection worth an additional US$111–$167 million per year."

This is primarily due to the fact that water availability far outstrips current or anticipated demand, eliminating the scarcity value of this resource. However, the importance of determining how key rivers and other waterways could be included into the national Protected Areas (PA) system is highlighted in the activities to be supported through this project. <br/><br/>As supported in the MMM valuation study, only a small fraction of the Moho River catchment has protected status. Thus, one of the activity to be included under this project will address confirming the actual or potential importance of the Moho River, and parts of the Rio Hondo, New, Belize and Temash Rivers to the system through detailed feasibility studies, and to assess what form(s) of protected area category out of the full range to be allowed for under the NPASA would be most appropriate."

Belize also boasts the longest barrier reef in the Western Hemisphere, part of the biologically rich Mesoamerican Reef complex, stretching from Mexico to Honduras. In total, the value of reef- and mangrove-related fisheries, tourism, and shoreline protection services in Belize is estimated to be US$395–$559 million per year.<br/><br/>Approximately 115,000 visitors were recorded by marine protected areas (MPAs) in 2007, spending an estimated US$17 million on accommodation, recreation, food, and other expenses on days that they visited a reserve. Actual spending may be up to 30 per cent higher as visitor numbers to most of the reserves is significantly under-recorded.<br/><br/>The economic analysis in the Coastal Capital (WRI, 2009) indicates that reef-related tourism and fisheries at just one park - Glover’s Reef Marine Reserve - contributed an estimated US$4.9 to $7.3 million per year to the national economy. Ecosystem goods include the diversity of fish species, especially the commercial species such as lobster, conch and shrimp. <br/><br/>A recent economic valuation of the EGS of the Maya Mountains Massif and Marine Corridor (terrestrial) area (Hammond et al. 2011) shows that the highest net present value is for ‘coastal tourism and fisheries’, which is estimated at US $ 24-40 million, discounted over a 30 year period.<br/><br/>Thus strengthened management of the marine protected areas, as a part of the national protected areas will continue to allow these and more benefits to the Belizean society from its coastal and marine resources."

The guiding principles of Belize’s National Land Use Policy are based on a holistic approach that incorporates considerations on equity, efficiency and practicability, development and sustainability. It recognizes that there are certain lands where the best use is conservation due to a variety of factors ranging from watershed protection, to landscape values, to habitat importance.",
		"alignment_nbsap": "The guiding principle of the NPAPSP is to ensure that the contribution of the protected areas system to national development and poverty alleviation is maximized, thereby putting it on a sound and rational footing. Furthermore, the NPAPSP is consistent with the environmental protection principles enshrined in the Constitution of Belize and is founded on the need to ensure that biodiversity conservation becomes an important and integral part of national social and economic development.  <br/><br/>Through this project, support will be garnered for the development of Belize’s National Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan, which will include the development of a sub-strategy and action plan for the seascape and landscape environments. Additionally, this project will provide critical support for key activities integral to biodiversity planning in Belize and includes support for the updating of the National Biodiversity Action Plan and a National Forestry Plan. Both of which will foster sustainable forest management approach in tropical forest to ensure the maintenance of biodiversity.  Furthermore, the project will assist in promoting Agroforestry and Silvipastoral systems as a landscape management approach to ensure harmonization of agricultural development and environmental conservation.",
		"alignment_cc": "A consultancy is currently under way to develop Belize’s National REDD+ strategy that will be based on the World Bank's Forest Carbon Partnership Facility template. The strategy is expected to be concluded by mid-March 2012 and will form the basis of future REDD + activities.<br/><br/>The Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment is participating in a REDD+ project in collaboration with Central American Commission for Environment and Development (CCAD) and German technical cooperation agency (GIZ).  Consequently, a REDD+ Technical Expert Group has been established to guide and oversee the execution of the REDD+-CCAD-GIZ project in Belize and was recently subsumed under the Mitigation Sub-committee of the Belize National Climate Change Committee (BNCCC). Thus, activities will not only include oversight and guidance for the GIZ project but all REDD+ related activities in Belize, as well as those related to Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry and more broadly forests and climate change.<br/><br/>Furthermore, a national workshop for the development of a National Monitoring Framework for changes in forest cover and carbon stocks in Belize was recently concluded. This framework will guide the development of a national monitoring and reporting system for REDD+ in Belize.",

		"title": "Reducing climate risk for vulnerable communities along South Africa's Garden Route",
		"summary": "The Garden Route region of South Africa, within the Cape Floristic Region, is an area of outstanding global biodiversity importance - renowned for its species richness and endemism. The area, with its tall forests unique in the country, is also extremely vulnerable to climate change, with documented increases in recent years in flooding, drought, coastal erosion and fire that are occurring as a consequence of increased climate variability and inappropriate land use and management.",
		"description": ". The Cape Floristic Region is one of South Africa’s three biodiversity hotspots, exhibiting extraordinary levels of endemism including c. 6,000 plant species. However, its biodiversity is threatened by urban development, agriculture, plantation forestry, and alien plant invasions; moreover, climate change is expected to have severe impacts (e.g. shrinking of the typical Fynbos biome by up to 65% by 2050).<br/><br/>. The project will operate in the “Garden Route” located in Eden District Municipality in the south-east of Western Cape Province. The Garden Route is comprised of the coastal strip of the District, extending over 390 km and averaging 50 km in width and bounded by mountains to the north. The region contains a unique mosaic of three of the country’s nine biomes – Fynbos, Thicket and Forest, including the country’s most outstanding extent of tall, natural forests (the Southern Cape Forests), as well as some of the country’s most important wetlands.<br/><br/>. The region has seen significantly increased climate variability over the past decade, with greater frequency and intensity of floods, droughts, storm surges, coastal erosion and fire. Major disasters including four “100 year floods” and the worst drought in 130 years caused local governments over EUR 33 million of damages. The insurance industry has been forced to re-evaluate its portfolio of assets in the region as claims have escalated. <br/><br/>. Water stress is compounded by infestation by water-intensive alien trees spreading from plantations into the critically important mountain catchments. Besides outcompeting indigenous vegetation, alien cover can reduce the water yield of a Fynbos catchment by up to 68% - which can be recovered following effective clearing. Alien clearing also reduces fire risk, predicted to increase with climate change. Preventing fires in turn reduces soil erosion, siltation of dams and estuaries, rainfall run-off and flooding.<br/><br/>. The area contains national and provincial protected areas, however these represent less than half of the habitat types and are not configured to promote connectivity or buffer climate change. To reduce the climate risk for human communities, enhance water provision and regulation services and support the resilience of biodiversity, the management of existing protected areas and private lands must be improved to eliminate invasive plants and allow regeneration of indigenous vegetation; connectivity must be recreated via landscape corridors including additional private and public conservation areas, enabling climate-induced relocation of plants and animals; and natural coastal defences like dune systems and estuarine mudflats need to be protected and rehabilitated.<br/><br/>. A number of stakeholders have begun taking proactive action: South Africa’s largest short term insurer Santam has assessed how better landscape management can reduce disaster risk; the national government now incentivises environmental rehabilitation by landowners; conservation agencies are committed to improving land management on private lands and on areas inherited from forestry; and the “Garden Route Initiative” formed by state and civil stakeholders has mapped unprotected Critical Biodiversity Areas and Ecological Support Areas requiring formal protection.<br/><br/>. However, the potential of functioning natural ecosystems in reducing disaster vulnerability is not yet recognised amongst local government, private businesses and landowners. The project’s partnership with the insurance company SANTAM and the Eden District government offers a unique opportunity to address this key barrier.",

		"timeframe": "",
		"ecological_contribution": "The exact sites of the rehabilitation work will be determined during the project preparation phase, using systematically defined national and local plans developed by the conservation community over the past decade. Systematic biodiversity planning (also known as systematic conservation planning) involves mapping a wide range of information about biodiversity features (including both biodiversity pattern and ecological processes) and patterns of land and resource use. Planners then set biodiversity targets and analyse the information using specialised software programmes linked to Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Systematic biodiversity plans focus on efficient solutions which meet the required biodiversity targets in configurations which are least costly to society in terms of conflict with other valid land-uses and in terms of the area required.  Outputs are interpreted and presented as maps with associated land-use guidelines at various spatial scales – to indicate where conservation action should be focused and to assess the implications of different land-use options for biodiversity. Conversely, the maps also indicate areas which are of less interest from a biodiversity perspective, and hence where developments should be facilitated.<br/><br/>Systematic biodiversity planning in South Africa has enabled a focus on ecosystems and ecological processes rather than on individual threatened species. This has meant that climate change issues can be incorporated in a spatially explicit manner, enabling systematic biodiversity planning to be consciously used as a tool for climate change adaptation. It places importance on aligning biodiversity priority areas with corridors and areas of intact natural habitat that are essential for maintaining landscape-scale ecological functions and the ecosystem services they provide. In addition, these biodiversity priority areas are aligned with biophysical features that support ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change. These features include intact river and coastal corridors, mountain ranges, areas with refuge habitats such as cooler south-facing slopes and ravines, areas with a range of microclimates, altitudinal gradients, climatic gradients, areas of high topographic variation, or other ecological gradients. These are features of the landscape that increase the resilience of ecosystems to climate change, allow for migration and dispersal of species, and contribute to ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change. <br/><br/>A key issue is avoiding the further fragmentation of landscapes, the loss or break-up of the best and most viable natural patches, and ensuring that landscapes are retained in as connected a configuration as possible. Securing corridors of well managed, natural or near-natural habitats is seen as critical to capturing environmental gradients that allow plant and animal species to move in response to climate change (Cadman et al., 2010). Corridors also play an important role in helping human communities adapt to the effects of climate change. For example, maintaining indigenous vegetation along rivers can prevent the banks from being eroded when rivers swell during heavy rainfall. Keeping wetland ecosystems in a healthy state is critical for gathering, managing and delivering water – improving water quality, controlling erosion, sustaining river flows during dry seasons and reducing the impact of floods. Maintaining coastal dunes, mangrove swamps, kelp beds and healthy estuaries can provide natural buffers and protect human settlements against storm surges and coastal flooding, at far lower cost than engineered solutions. <br/><br/>Systematic biodiversity planning (incorporating climate change design principles) is being used to develop “biodiversity sector plans” across the country with broad stakeholder participation. The Garden Route Biodiversity Sector Plan (2010) is based on a fine-scale systematic biodiversity plan (1:50 000 and finer) and provides maps of “critical biodiversity areas” or CBAs, and “ecological support areas” or ESAs. CBAs are areas required to meet conservation targets for biodiversity pattern and ecological processes. ESAs are areas required to support the ecological functioning of CBAs, and/or to deliver ecosystem services. A critical difference between ESAs and CBAs is that CBAs must be maintained in a natural or near-natural state, while the emphasis with ESAs is that they should remain at least in a functional state. The maps are accompanied by land-use guidelines linked to them, a short biodiversity profile of the region to provide contextual information, monitoring and review arrangements and supporting GIS data.",

				"comment": "Adaptation of communities in mountain catchments and the coastal zone will be facilitated by improving water infiltration, mitigating droughts and floods, and reducing fires and coastal erosion. Securing water supplies will enable adaptation of agriculture, forestry and tourism. Public and private sector adaptive capacities will increase, ensuring that EBA is integrated in local adaptation strategies. Demonstration results can be replicated nationally and globally, noting that South Africa is a model case in terms of its innovative approaches to landscape planning and management."

				"term": "Climate Change Mitigation",
				"termid": "ecoservices1",
				"comment": "The project is designed to address adaptation but will have mitigation benefits by reducing the scale and severity of uncontrolled fires and thus emissions of CO2. This will be achieved through removal of invasive alien vegetation and enhanced land management practices in at least two mountain river catchments. The increased fuel load in areas infested by aliens, combined with an anticipated 41% increase in high fire risk periods for 2020-2050 would otherwise likely result in intense fires that would turn these catchments from a carbon sink into an atmospheric carbon source."

				"term": "Food Security",
				"termid": "ecoservices4",
				"comment": "One of the key activities in the project is more effective elimination of invasive species from the region, which are encroaching on both natural protected and agricultural habitats. Improved land management will reduce the fuel load available from invasive alien plants and hence fire risk, avoiding damage to agricultural lands. Together with improved water quality and supply, if not the wholesale avoidance of severe droughts and floods in the target area, this will result in huge benefits to local agricultural production and food security."

			{
				"term": "Freshwater Security",
				"termid": "ecoservices3",
				"comment": "The target region has faced a series of extreme water-related natural disasters over the past decade, including several 100-year droughts and floods, which are caused by climate change and inappropriate land management. Securing and restoring water supply and quality through the water regulating services provided by natural ecosystems in the region and particularly in the targeted river catchments, is one of the key objectives of the project. Conserving and rehabilitating natural vegetation will reduce water run-off as well as water consumption by alien plants, enhance groundwater storage, and distribute water supply more evenly over the year in both upland and coastal communities, benefiting private households, agricultural production and local industry likewise. Reducing fire risk at the same time will equally prevent desertification and soil erosion in both natural and agricultural landscapes."

				"termid": "ecoservices7",
				"comment": "The project will directly provide livelihood opportunities in a poverty stricken region of South Africa, by providing employment in labour-intensive land management schemes that will demonstrate the viability, effectiveness and cost-efficiency of ecosystem management approaches to climate risk reduction; the project expects that the scheme will be continued consequently through investment by local and national government and private sector benefiting at the same time the protected areas with their biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide for the long term. Moreover, the project offers a medium to long term solution to the water scarcity to which the local tourism industry has been exposed undermining its business model."

					"title": "Reducing climate risk for vulnerable communities along South Africa's Garden Route",
					"summary": "The Garden Route region of South Africa, within the Cape Floristic Region, is an area of outstanding global biodiversity importance - renowned for its species richness and endemism. The area, with its tall forests unique in the country, is also extremely vulnerable to climate change, with documented increases in recent years in flooding, drought, coastal erosion and fire that are occurring as a consequence of increased climate variability and inappropriate land use and management.",
					"description": ". The Cape Floristic Region is one of South Africa’s three biodiversity hotspots, exhibiting extraordinary levels of endemism including c. 6,000 plant species. However, its biodiversity is threatened by urban development, agriculture, plantation forestry, and alien plant invasions; moreover, climate change is expected to have severe impacts (e.g. shrinking of the typical Fynbos biome by up to 65% by 2050).<br/><br/>. The project will operate in the “Garden Route” located in Eden District Municipality in the south-east of Western Cape Province. The Garden Route is comprised of the coastal strip of the District, extending over 390 km and averaging 50 km in width and bounded by mountains to the north. The region contains a unique mosaic of three of the country’s nine biomes – Fynbos, Thicket and Forest, including the country’s most outstanding extent of tall, natural forests (the Southern Cape Forests), as well as some of the country’s most important wetlands.<br/><br/>. The region has seen significantly increased climate variability over the past decade, with greater frequency and intensity of floods, droughts, storm surges, coastal erosion and fire. Major disasters including four “100 year floods” and the worst drought in 130 years caused local governments over EUR 33 million of damages. The insurance industry has been forced to re-evaluate its portfolio of assets in the region as claims have escalated. <br/><br/>. Water stress is compounded by infestation by water-intensive alien trees spreading from plantations into the critically important mountain catchments. Besides outcompeting indigenous vegetation, alien cover can reduce the water yield of a Fynbos catchment by up to 68% - which can be recovered following effective clearing. Alien clearing also reduces fire risk, predicted to increase with climate change. Preventing fires in turn reduces soil erosion, siltation of dams and estuaries, rainfall run-off and flooding.<br/><br/>. The area contains national and provincial protected areas, however these represent less than half of the habitat types and are not configured to promote connectivity or buffer climate change. To reduce the climate risk for human communities, enhance water provision and regulation services and support the resilience of biodiversity, the management of existing protected areas and private lands must be improved to eliminate invasive plants and allow regeneration of indigenous vegetation; connectivity must be recreated via landscape corridors including additional private and public conservation areas, enabling climate-induced relocation of plants and animals; and natural coastal defences like dune systems and estuarine mudflats need to be protected and rehabilitated.<br/><br/>. A number of stakeholders have begun taking proactive action: South Africa’s largest short term insurer Santam has assessed how better landscape management can reduce disaster risk; the national government now incentivises environmental rehabilitation by landowners; conservation agencies are committed to improving land management on private lands and on areas inherited from forestry; and the “Garden Route Initiative” formed by state and civil stakeholders has mapped unprotected Critical Biodiversity Areas and Ecological Support Areas requiring formal protection.<br/><br/>. However, the potential of functioning natural ecosystems in reducing disaster vulnerability is not yet recognised amongst local government, private businesses and landowners. The project’s partnership with the insurance company SANTAM and the Eden District government offers a unique opportunity to address this key barrier.",
