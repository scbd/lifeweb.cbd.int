	"projectAbstract": "The project will take place in the Department of Olancho, one of the most important regions related to forestry resources, which are very important for the national and local economy. The majority of the local communities involved in this project live in poverty, and lack the tools and mechanisms to effectively participate in the management of protected areas. The project objectives include consolidating the network of protected areas (7) of the Region of Olancho, managing PAs effectively and  participatively and achieving an ecologically representative network, in order to accomplish environmental, social and economic functions.",
	"description": "The project will take place in the Department of Olancho, one of the most important regions related to forestry resources, which are very important for the national and local economy. The majority of the local communities involved in this project lives in poverty conditions, and lacks the tools and mechanisms to effectively participate in the management of protected areas. Most of the Olancho department is covered by pine-oak and dry forests ecosystems, both ecosystems are categorized by WWF as critically endangered. <br/><br/>In Olancho we find 10 protected areas that are under low management practices, and threatened by unsustainable forestry practices, forest fires of great magnitude, plagues and diseases, advance of the agricultural frontier, and pressure to provide goods and services to local communities. The major challenges are strengthen the local capacities to improve the management of protected areas, create conditions to local participation in protected areas management; consolidate an effective network of well managed protected areas; and, ensure the provision of environmental goods and services to local communities. The project will contribute to reduce poverty in local communities, conservation of biodiversity of national and global importance, and contribute to accomplish the Program of Work on Protected Areas of the CBD.",
	"additionalInformation": "\n[participation]\nThis project will contribute with the consolidation of co-management, advisory councils, payment mechanisms for environmental goods and services, elaboration and implementation of management plans.",
