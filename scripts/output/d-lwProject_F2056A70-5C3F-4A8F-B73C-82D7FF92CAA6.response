At present, this includes 56 protected areas, covering 12.602.320 ha, equivalent to 9.3% of Colombia's terrestrial area and 1.98% of its marine area.",
	"description": "Threats to biodiversity in Colombia's National Parks System (SPNN) are numerous, complex and include: <br/>- Illegal timber and faunal extraction and trade.<br/>- Governance, as most PA areas present conflicts over land ownership, overlap with indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities, and constant pressures from unsustainable productive systems.<br/>- Economic development mega-projects, planned for Colombia´s developing economy, including mining projects.<br/>- Climate change, mainly threatening the Amazon PA, high mountain PA, dry forests (currently under-represented in the system), and coastal and marine PA.<br/> <br/>The System main challenges to be addressed by the project are:<br/>- The consolidation and coordination of the National System of Protected Areas (SINAP):<br/>1.\tIncreasing the ecosystem representativeness of the National Parks System (SPNN).<br/>2.\tEstablishing the financial sustainability of the National Parks System based on its ecological and environmental values and services.<br/>3.\tUpdating the inventory of all the National System of Protected Areas and their classification to IUCN categories.<br/>4.\tDeveloping the policy, administrative, and intersectoral strategies established for the SINAP.<br/>5.\tPromoting, at local, regional, national and international levels, awareness and active involvement of PAs’ stakeholders.<br/><br/>- The improvement of governance and management effectiveness at the National Parks System (SPNN):<br/>1.\tIncrease representativeness and connectivity of under-represented Colombian ecosystems. <br/>2.\tSolving land titling issues for PAs.<br/>3.\tUpdating boundary marking for at least 20 PAs.<br/>4.\tIncreasing and improve PAs’ control and surveillance.<br/>5.\tUpdating and improving information management tools.<br/>6.\tImproving implementation and effective monitoring of PAs.<br/>7.\tActively involving local communities on ecological restoration activities at  least in seven PA(Alto Fragua Indi Wasi, Catatumbo Bari, Farallones, Munchique, Nevados, Orquídeas, Paramillo).<br/>8.\tImplementing and developing management agreements with communities from overlapping indigenous reserves and neighboring Afro-Colombian territories (signed and in implementation: Catatumbo, Utría, Los Flamencos, Farallones, Paramillo, Cahuinarí; to be signed: Nevado del Huila, Puracé, Macuira, Las Orquídeas, Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Cocuy, Los Katíos, Gorgona, Sanquianga, Old Providence & Mc Bean Lagoon). <br/><br/>SEE ANNEX 3: PoWPA Progress Report for National Park System of Colombia, 2009",

As 20% of climate change gases come from deforestation and anthropic uses of soil, effectively managed PA would prevent loss of carbon stocks present in soil and vegetation in unique ecosystems with high biodiversity. <br/>c.\tActive restoration activities with local communities, as proposed for the PA, will contibute to mitigation in the wide range of ecosystems included in the SPNN: rainforests, mountain ecosystems, savannahs, mangroves and estuaries.<br/>d.\tNew protected areas will cover currently un- and under-represented ecosystems (such as dry forests and continental wetlands) which will otherwise transform, under current anthropic pressures, from carbon sequestration areas to carbon sources. Natural regeneration as the PA will further improve sequestration and mitigation.  <br/>"
