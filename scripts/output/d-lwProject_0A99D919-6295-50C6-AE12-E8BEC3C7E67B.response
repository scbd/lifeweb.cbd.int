However, due to current economic conditions, there is a lack of adequate financing to ensure the continued development of the national park. As a result, the national park is in jeopardy of being left unattended.  The objectives of the project are to develop infrastructure for CLNP, build capacity among staff to implement management activities in the park, and re-establishing natural protective barriers from natural disasters around the park.",
	"description": "Codrington Lagoon National Park (CLNP), located in Codrington Village Barbuda, is in the preliminary stages of development. However, due to current economic conditions, there is a lack of adequate financing to ensure the continued development of the national park. As a result, the national park is in jeopardy of being left unattended.  There are a number of species of international importance in the national park. These species face extinction if adequate financing and human resource capacity is not developed for the effective management of the national park. The national park also faces threats from over fishing, indiscriminate development, invasive alien species and natural disasters.",
	"additionalInformation": "\n[participation]\nBarbuda is a very close and engaging community. In light of this, the project will be executed through the use of a stakeholder board which represents the relevant stakeholders in Barbuda. These will include representatives from the Fishermen association, the small business association, the taxi association and the local government authority and agencies.  All persons will be engaged at all stages of the projectâ€™s implementation to ensure effective participation and buy-in from all concerned.",
