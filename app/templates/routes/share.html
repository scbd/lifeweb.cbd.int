<h3 style="color:#2185C5;">LifeWeb promotes partnership, commitment, and progress in achieving coherent and effective implementation of the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity, and in particular, how biodiversity contributes as a solution to poverty eradication, climate change and sustainable development.
</h3>
<p>The Conference of Parties (COP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), in its decision X/31 on protected areas, encouraged Parties to make use of the CBD LifeWeb Initiative as a platform to communicate funding needs for the implementation of national action plans for the programme of work on protected areas (PoWPA) and encouraged public and private donors to match these needs with targeted support.
</p>
<p>At its eleventh meeting, the COP, in paragraphs 4 and 5 of decision XI/24, encouraged bilateral and multilateral donors, Parties and countries in a position to do so, to support mobilization of funding to implement national action plans for the PoWPA through national, subregional and regional donor round table meetings, taking into account funding needs assessments, financial planning and funding strategies contained in national action plans for the PoWPA.
</p>
<p>Also COP 11, the Executive Secretary presented an information document (UNEP/CBD/COP/11/INF/48). “The LifeWeb Initiative: A Review of Progress and Options for the Future” containing suggestions on how to harmonise the CBD LifeWeb Initiative with the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its Aichi Targets. This document was part of a wider consultation conducted by the Executive Secretary to get feedback from Parties, donors and partners on how to strengthen alignment of the LifeWeb Initiative with the achievement of the Aichi Targets. As a result the scope of the LifeWeb Initiative was broadened to offer the opportunity to CBD Parties, in particular developing country Parties or countries with economies in transition, local and indigenous communities to seek financial support for projects consistent with the area-based Aichi Targets of the Strategic Plan through the LifeWeb Clearinghouse. This change will allow Parties to post their financial needs for projects related to the PoWPA and Aichi Target 11 and also for Aichi Targets 5, 9, 12, 13, 14 and 15.
