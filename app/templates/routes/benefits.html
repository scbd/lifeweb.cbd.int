 <p>    
 The current global financial crisis provides an opportunity to develop a new economic system that is harmonious with the earth’s natural capital. To do so, a suite of changes to global markets are required to recognize the full and true costs and economic value of the goods and services delivered by protected areas. Comprehensive investment in the global network of protected areas is not only critical to safeguard the future of the planet’s biodiversity but also provides a demonstrably significant return on investment. Protected areas are cornerstones for biodiversity conservation and are both powerful tools for addressing climate change, and providing sustainable economic development. Protected areas address climate change through ecosystem-based adaptation and as a means of maximising carbon sequestration and minimising further losses of stored carbon. Here are just a few examples:

<ul>

<li>12% of global greenhouse gas emissions result from deforestation and forest degradation.</li>
Protected areas provide a critical wealth of ecosystem services, including freshwater and food security, storm protection, regulating spread of diseases, cultural and spiritual access, and others.</li>

<li>Nearly 1.1 billion people depend on forest protected areas for their livelihoods.</li>

<li>Potential fishing benefits from healthy coral reefs are estimated to be US$5.7 billion annually.</li>

<li>For more information of the value of protected areas, please click here.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>

The fact that 12.2% of the earth's terrestrial surface is under some form of government designated protected area status is a significant cause for hope. This percentage has been estimated to be as high as 20%, if community conserved areas are included. However, an unfortunate reality is that only a fraction of these areas are being effectively managed and many habitat types are severely underrepresented, particularly freshwater and marine areas. The Programme of Work on Protected Areas of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) constitutes the major reference framework in the worldwide effort to establish a global network of biologically representative and effectively managed protected areas. This Programme of Work came into effect at the seventh meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the CBD in 2004. 192 countries have committed themselves to implementing this historic framework of 4 elements, 16 targets, and 92 time-bound actions.</p>



<div class="bs-docs-fact">
The cost of establishing and maintaining a global protected area system has been estimated at US$30 billion per year while current expenditures are estimated at only US$6.5 billion per year. A shocking portion of protected areas, often in high biodiversity regions, are essentially paper parks without any active regulation or management to ensure the aforementioned wealth of services is intact and continues to benefit people.

As a means of maximizing carbon sequestration and minimizing further losses of stored carbon, protected areas provide a powerful tool to address climate change. Their role has been recognized by the international community addressing climate change, but is generally undervalued and under explored. Protected areas have long been one of the cornerstones of biodiversity conservation. Used to promote the protection of ecosystems, natural habitats and the maintenance of viable populations of species in natural surroundings, they remain not only vital to the conservation of the world's natural and cultural resources in the face of climate change but also have an important role to play in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions by storing and sequestering carbon and potentially preventing future deforestation.

<div class="bs-docs-fact">
Some intact ecosystems store or sequester huge quantities of carbon within their biomass; protected ecosystems can also act as carbon sinks, actively absorbing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as part of the global carbon cycle. Intact coastal wetlands, including mangroves sequester 1.5 tons of carbon per hectare per year.An intact tropical forest stores between 170-250 tons of carbon per hectare (tC/ha).
</div>

<div class="bs-docs-fact">
Protecting ecosystems from deforestation or allowing degraded land to regenerate can increase ecosystem resilience and capture additional carbon. Land use change and in particular deforestation already accounts for approximately 12% of all greenhouse gas emissions.

Protected areas are important tools to ensure water supply for domestic use, agriculture and industry. Well designed protected areas can safeguard natural ecosystems, protect local rural populations and provide water for agriculture while simultaneously securing downstream water supplies for urban areas. The role of protected areas in freshwater security is seriously under appreciated and undervalued, especially in light of the multiple benefits they can provide to local livelihoods, biodiversity and recreation.
 
<div class="bs-docs-fact">
Approximately one-third of the world’s largest cities rely on freshwater from protected areas. Approximately 80% of Quito, Ecuador’s drinking water is derived from two protected areas: the Antisana and Cayambe-Coca Ecological Reserves.
</div>

<div class="bs-docs-fact">
The freshwater provided by protected areas and natural catchments is worth billions of dollars per year. 2.7m people in Peru use water that originates from 16 protected areas with an estimated value of US$81m. The rivers in these protected areas also contribute to 60% of Peru's hydroelectricity generation, with an estimated value of US$320m.
</div>

<div class="bs-docs-fact">
Forest protected areas and intact forest catchments reduce siltation and pollutants and improve the quality and clarity of freshwater. Approximately 90% of Melbourne, Australia’s freshwater supply originates in forest catchments.
</div>

<div class="bs-docs-fact">
Catchments and watercourses protected in order to secure freshwater supplies may have high biodiversity and can provide synergistic benefits to conservation and livelihoods. 
Bukit Timah NP in Singapore was created to protect urban water supplies and has simultaneous benefits to biodiversity conservation as both a wildlife haven and the last intact forest on Singapore Island
</div>

Plant genetic resources are invaluable for present and future generations. Their importance is more pronounced now given the reality of climate change, since more extreme adaptation in agricultural crops is necessary. There is therefore a need for fresh genetic material that is resilient or has wider tolerance as changing conditions increase. Wild relatives of globally important crops such as barley, maize, oats, potatoes, rice and wheat are becoming more productive. Many examples highlight the importance of conserving crop wild relatives as sources of novel traits for resistance to disease and drought, and tolerance to extreme temperatures and salinity. Protected areas hold important plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, including endemic and threatened crop wild relatives and land races for food production. Many successful examples of plant agrobiodiversity conservation in protected areas already exist around the world, both in conventional protected areas that contain crop wild relatives and in specially designed on-farm areas tailored to the conservation of traditional land races.

Well-managed protected areas support healthy ecosystems that in turn support healthy people. When ecosystem health declines, one consequence is increased disease risk for vulnerable people. There are many links between human and wildlife health and ecosystem health. Forest clearings create “edges,” where the interactions among pathogens, vectors and hosts are increased. They also concentrate wildlife populations into smaller patches of habitat, and increase the odds that these animals get in contact with humans and domestic animals. This in turn increases the number of pathogens and parasites jumping from wildlife to people (or their livestock), and/or vice versa. There is now evidence that forest clearing has increased the spread of diseases such as malaria, leishmaniasis, avian flu, Ebola and SARS.

<div class="bs-docs-fact">The 32,000 ha Ruteng Park on the island of Flores in Indonesia protects a critical watershed in the region, for its towns and farms. The park provides timber, fuel wood, clean water and a variety of forest products of regional value. Researchers working with Conservation International’s Center for Applied Biodiversity Science found that in communities living near the protected area, there were fewer illnesses from malaria and dysentery, children missed less school because of improved health, and less hunger was associated with crop failure than in communities without intact forests nearby. Villages within the vicinity of intact forest cover also had improved water quality. These benefits of healthy forests within protected areas are not widely known.
</div>

<div class="bs-docs-fact">Researchers created an economic model of the Amazonian Brazilian economy to examine how investments in conservation such as protected areas would provide quantifiable economic benefits in the form of improved human health. Findings show that the expected costs of new Amazonian protected areas, measured in reduced forestry and agricultural production, are offset by expected benefits in reduced disease incidence. This demonstrates how large-scale investments in conservation also support economic growth by improving human health.

Spiritual and cultural values are the intangible benefits of protected areas. They are difficult to quantify in economic terms. In so many ways and in so many places, sacred sites, beliefs, faith groups and protected areas meet, from the water sources inhabited by ancestor spirits of Madagascar’s parks and reserves to the Christian monasteries in Romania’s protected areas, from the pilgrimage routes walked by millions of Hindus and Buddhists in India and Nepal to the mountains, holy for Jews, Christians and Muslims alike. Protected areas also help to bring back and sustain long held cultural traditions such as local taboos, or hunting and harvesting seasons result in temporary closures of certain areas (e.g. in many Locally Managed Marine Areas in the Pacific). Protected areas also provide sanctuary for culturally important species (e.g. Dugong, turtles, etc.), protecting and managing populations so that they can be harvested for specific cultural events. 



<div class="bs-docs-fact">

Some examples of sacred sites in existing protected areas and their spiritual interactions include:

<ul>
<li>Mount Kailash, in Parsa Wildlife reserve in the autonomous region of Tibetis an important pilgrimage site for followers of many faiths, including Buddhism, Bön, Jainism, and Hinduism. Most pilgrims walk a holy “kora,” or circuit of the mountain (a distance of 56 kilometres which ascends to over 5,700 metres above sea level).</li>

<li>Gunung Mutis Nature Reserve in West Timor and Indonesia is important to the Meto indigenous people, whose spiritual relationship with nature is of great significance to daily life. Rituals are centred on ancestor worship.</li>

<li>Jirisan National Park in South Korea houses eight Buddhist temples and many cultural treasures (e.g. Gakhwangjeon, a three-story stone pagoda propping up four lions, and the remarkable Gakhwhangjjeon seokdeung, one of the largest existing stone lights).</li>

<li>Shivapuri National Park in Nepal is spiritually significant for the popular shrines and meditation centres for Hindus and Buddhists nestled in the natural surroundings. The Budhanilkantha and Sundarimai shrines and the Nagi monastery attract thousands of pilgrims during festive seasons.</li>

<li>Argentina’s Lanin National Park, its Mapuche Indian name meaning “dead rock,” is famous for its monkeypuzzle tree (Araucaria araucana), which is sacred to the Mapuche Indians, or the “Earth people.”</li>

<li>RB-EB del Beni (Beni Biosphere Reserve and Biological Station), Bolivia is home to the “Chimane,” an ethnic » » group who keep and practice their ancestral rites and customs.</li>
<li>
Muntanya de Montserrat National Park, Spain, is nestled in the rocky mountain Montserrat near Barcelona, in Catalonia. It harbours 12 hermitages and two Catholic monasteries, one of which is devoted to the Holy Virgin Mary and has been a pilgrimage centre since the 
14th century. Because of its many spiritual, cultural and natural values, Montserrat has become an outstanding identity symbol of Catalonia.</li>

<li>Boabeng Fiema-Monkey Sanctuary, Ghana, is considered as a sacred grove because it supports populations of black and white Colobus monkey (Colobus vellerosus) and Mona monkey (Cercopithecus mona), both of which are revered and strictly protected as sons of the gods of the people of Boabeng and Fiema villages.</li>
</ul>
</div>

Sacred sites also support high biodiversity values, holding considerable potential to support conservation efforts through developing “people-inclusive” protected area management objectives. Because of their unique intercultural and interdisciplinary character they can be a suitable means for environmental education, cross-cultural learning and intergenerational transmission of spiritual and bio-cultural knowledge. The sacred and spiritual dimensions of protected areas reiterate their role in upholding cultural and spiritual values that, like biodiversity, are at risk of external pressures and threats.

Many people in rural areas depend on protected forests, pastures, wetlands and marine areas for their livelihoods. Protected areas, when carefully designed and managed, can contribute to poverty reduction and sustainable development including the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The provisioning services (food, fuel, fresh water and herbal medicines) of protected areas have direct use and value to rural communities. Ensuring environmental sustainability is one of the Millennium Development Goals. One of the indicators to measure progress towards this goal is the percentage of areas under protection. There is increasing recognition that conservation efforts supporting protected area creation and management are essential to achieving the other Millennium Development Goals and the post 2015 development agenda, since these areas maintain healthy ecosystems and their services. Yet biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation pose a significant threat to the achievement of Millennium Development Goals.

Travel and tourism is one of the world’s largest economic activities. International tourism grew by 10% in 2004 to reach a record high of more than 764 million arrivals and receipts increasing by 9.2% to US$ 633 billion. This growth is in part driven by growing interest in ecotourism and by the increasing numbers of visitors to protected areas. 

<div class="bs-docs-fact">Galapagos National Park and Marine Reserve exceeded 140,000 visitors in 2006 up over 100% in the past decade. Bolivia’s Eduardo Avaroa Reserve has seen an increase from 8,000 visitors in 1999 to over 60,000 in 2005.
